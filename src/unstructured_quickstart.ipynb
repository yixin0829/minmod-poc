            "On 26 May 2017, Forrester Metals Inc. (\u201cForrester\u201d) of Toronto, Ontario Canada accepted the proposal of Watts, Griffis and McOuat Limited (\"WGM\") to prepare a technical report that is compliant with Canada\u2019s security rule National Instrument 43-101 (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d) for the Bongar\u00e1 zinc-oxide project (the \u201cProject\u201d). On June 1, 2017, Zinc One Resources Inc. (\u201cZinc One\u201d) of Vancouver, Canada acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Forrester Metals Inc. As a result, this report has been prepared for Zinc One.\n",
            "\n",
            "The area of interest is located in the Yambrasbamba District of Bongar\u00e1 Province within the Amazonas Department in north-central Peru. The Project is located approximately 695 km north-northwest of Lima and 190 west-northwest of the nearest airport at Tarapoto (Figure 1). The Project includes eight mineral concessions for 8,009.5 hectares (\u201cha\u201d) that comprise the Bongar\u00e1 Zinc Mine Project (\u201cBZMP\u201d) and five mineral concessions for 3,115.4 ha that comprise the Charlotte-Bongar\u00e1 Zone Project (\u201cCBZP\u201d).\n",
            "\n",
            "The Project is hosted within a substantial zinc belt that extends the entire length of Peru and hosts a great many carbonate replacement deposits of various genetic affinities.\n",
            "\n",
            "The BZMP mineralization was discovered by Canadian geologist William Menges in 1973. A number of companies have explored the area since that time including Noranda Explorations Co. (1974-1984), Canper Resources (1986), Solitario Resources (\u201cSolitario\u201d) (1993-95), Cominco Ltd. (1997)), Mauricio Hochschild & C\u00eda. (\u201cMHC\u201d) (2003-2005), and C\u00eda. Minera Corianta SA (\u201cCorianta\u201d) (2005-2011). Zinc One commenced its exploration program in September, 2017, which started with sampling of existing exploration pits followed by drilling in 2018.\n",
            "\n",
            "WGM first visited the Property in the mid- and late 1980s for Cominco. During 1987, WGM made a historical \u201cpreliminary resource estimate\u201d that was based on 20 test pits and resulted in a historical resource of 325,000 tonnes averaging 27.8% Zn and 1.8% Pb. While this estimate was made by appropriately qualified professionals, it was completed prior to the implementation of current Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\"CIM\") standards for classifying Mineral Resource estimates as required under NI 43-101 and should therefore not be relied upon for investment decisions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Many pits have been excavated, most notably 497 hand-dug pits on a nominal 25 metre grid by Solitario during 1993-95. A subsequent Solitario historical mineral resources estimate in 1995 was based on the test-pits and was predicated on the use of a 7.5% Zn+Pb cut-off grade\n",

            "\n",
            "This estimate produced historical resources of approximately 1.64 Mt at 19.3% Zn and 2.3% Pb for the main zone of mineralization at Mina Grand\u00e9 and approximately 0.27 Mt at 19.0% Zn and 1.3% Pb in a smaller zone referred to as Mina Chica. Like the historical WGM estimate, these resources are not compliant with CIM standards and guidelines and cannot be relied upon. Following this, MHC drilled 69 diamond holes totalling 1,974.88 m during 2003-2005.\n",
            "\n",
            "The CBZP was the focus of exploration between 2006 and 2011 by Rio Cristal Resources Corp. and its predecessor (\u201cRio Cristal\u201d). Its mineral concessions covered a larger area than Zinc One\u2019s concessions today. Within that larger area, at least 773 rock, 871 soil and 339 stream-sediment samples were collected, and in addition, 97 diamond holes totalling 9,141.7 m were drilled with a focus on the Cristal and Charlita prospects. Near-surface, high- grade, zinc-oxide mineralization was encountered throughout the area, however an NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate was never filed. Approximately 150,000 tonnes of zinc ore was mined from the Mina Grand\u00e9 Centro and Mina Grand\u00e9 North sectors of the BZMP during 2007-08 (see Figure 1). High-grade ore was shipped to the coast where it was treated using a Waelz kiln to produce zinc calcine that was sold to various smelters and approximately 25,000 tonnes of zinc metal was produced. Corianta explored the area to the northwest and completed surface sampling and trenching at Camp Cielo (see Figure 1).\n",
            "\n",
            "The most recent historical mineral resources estimated at Bongar\u00e1 are from a 2011 report by Corianta that cited 1.01 Mt at a grade of 21.61% Zn as \u201cmeasured\u201d and \u201cindicated\u201d and 0.21 Mt at a grade of 21.18% Zn a \u201cinferred\u201d from five zones: 1) Mina Grand\u00e9 Sur, 2) Mina Grand\u00e9 Centro, 3) Mina Grand\u00e9 Nort\u00e9, 4) Mina Chica, and 5) Bongarita. Although the resource categories are not compliant with CIM definitions, the higher confidence areas are relevant as they represent the main targets for future exploration and development work on the Bongar\u00e1 zinc-oxide mineralization.\n",
            "\n",

The BZMP Mineral Resources occur in five zones of variable mineralization that have the potential for economic extraction of zinc from oxide-type zinc mineralization. The minimum 10% zinc cut-off grade was selected in order to determine the amount of higher-grading mineral resources approaching 20% zinc. WGM\u2019s sensitivity analysis included additional estimates using cut-off grades of 5% and 15% zinc. The block sizes used for the estimates were applied with the assumption that the resources have potential bulk mineable characteristics and have been appropriately estimated using these parameters. Mineral Resource estimates, with an effective date of January 30, 2019, are summarised as follows in Tables 2 and 3.\n",

To support this work, Zinc One has applied to the Ministry of Energy and Mining for approval to drill 583 holes from 364 platforms along a 1.4 kilometre long ridge from Mina Grand\u00e9 Sur to and beyond Mina Chica. The platforms planned for in-fill drilling of the known deposits are laid out in a nominal 30 metre grid spacing. Those holes that explore for new mineralization are planned on a nominal 50 metre drilling grid. A total 141 platforms, each to be permitted for two drill holes, will delineate and infill previous drilling at Mina Chica and Mina Grand\u00e9. Exploration drilling will be prioritized in favourable settings within areas of low-lying or stunted vegetation that may represent areas of zinc toxicity.

The Mina Grand\u00e9 Centro and Nort\u00e9 workings and Mina Chica were outlined in detail by GPS track at the time they were examined and check sampled by WGM. All track and sample location (waypoint) data were collected using the PSAD-56 datum and imported into Google Earth software. All sites reported an estimated precision error of less than 3 metres. The fourth day was spent at the drying facility near the village of Yambrasbamba in a failed effort to examine Bongar\u00e1 drill core prior to beginning the return trip to Tarapoto (most of the core was lost and remaining core was unusable. A total of 16 samples were collected of mineralization in outcrop for multi-element analysis by ICP, quantitative ore- grade analysis for zinc, lead and silver and a determination of major elements (oxides) by fusion XRF. Water content data and specific gravity determinations were requested on all samples. The samples were delivered by WGM to the SGS laboratory in Lakefield, Ontario.

Most of the time on site was spent in prolonged question and answer sessions on project protocols focusing on geological logging, measuring, sampling and security procedures. WGM had the opportunity to observe the drillers activities, the attention paid to rpm and torque, the removal of core from the core-tube and generally how well the drillers and assistants co-ordinate their activities. As it was the rainy season, the working conditions were far from ideal yet WGM observed a high degree of competence and professionalism within the drilling crew. WGM noted the interactions between the drillers and the geologists, and was satisfied that the work was carried out in an atmosphere of mutual co-operation. WGM also observed the geologists logging core and was able to confirm the use of a standardized legend and notational format for recording data. The marking of intervals for analysis, cutting and sampling of drill core followed a conventional approach in accordance with industry best practices. An unusual format was used for numbering samples, however it was well understood by the geologists and served the purpose of identifying intervals without the flagging of consecutive samples that pre-numbered tags provided. WGM\u2019s set of 10 duplicate drill core samples provided assays that generally confirmed the Zinc One\u2019s assay results (see Section 12.3 in Chapter 12 \u2013 Data Verification in this report). Overall, the WGM geologist was satisfied that the degree of care taken on the project site was appropriate, and that the Zinc One exploration program was producing accurate and representative results.\n",

            "WGM Senior Associate Resource Geologist, John Reddick, P.Geo., visited the project site from 11-13 June, 2018. Mr. Reddick visited all areas of the project in order to better understand the physical and geological setting of the mineralization. He was accompanied by Dr. Bill Williams of Zinc One, and the exploration team. Mr. Reddick observed the drillers in action to gauge the level of expertise and care taken in operating the drill and checked the location of drill pads. In discussion with Zinc One personnel he reviewed sections and plans that were current at the time, checked the logging of drill core and photographed some of the better drill holes for which assay results had been received. Core boxes were weighed to calculate in-situ density to estimate the bulk density of the rock over a defined interval from which the volume could be known. This resulted in a specific gravity value of 1.9 T/m3, for mineralized material that matched well with the overall SG used previously. This is still not well understood as the values for individual boxes of drill core are highly variable, a problem that WGM attributes to the occurrence of voids and also to the presence of broken core. The over-riding purpose of Mr. Reddick\u2019s visit was to develop an understanding of the controls on mineralization (oxidized MVT) and its spatial distribution (original contacts modified by oxidation, distribution of economic metal modified by oxidation and chemical transport, contacts modified by post mineral faulting and erosion).\n",

            "Zinc metal pricing is predominantly established through major metal exchanges such as the London Metal Exchange, commonly referred to as the \u201cLME\u201d. Like many metals, the zinc spot price quoted on the LME has shown some volatility during 2018, trading between approximately $1.05 and $1.64 per pound ($2,315 to $3,616 per tonne). This information drawn from the Kitco Website on 29 January, 2019 shows that the zinc spot price most ($2,645-$2,667/tonne), recently has (www.kitco.com ). During the past year, LME warehoused zinc has been drawn down from approximately 220,000 tonnes to 115,300 tonnes as at 28 January, 2019. Over a 5-year period, the current LME zinc inventory has fallen from nearly 1 million tonnes in late 2013, a remarkable decline that is continuing. This inventory draw-down is in the face of some new production that has entered the market and is partially the result of suspended operations at many zinc smelters in China. What might be seen as circumstances favouring significantly higher zinc prices in the future is therefore balanced against shut-in production capacity and a fear of an economic slowdown and lower demand during 2019. However, within the context of a mine development timetable, the outlook for higher future zinc prices is generally positive.\n",

            "Although it has not been recently worked on by Zinc One, the Cristal zinc prospect is located about 6.5 km northwest of Mina Grand\u00e9 in a comparable geological setting. During the period 12-26 September, 2011, geological consultant Miguel Zulueta completed a digital resource estimate of the Cristal Zone for Cerro la Mina SA., based on a 96-drill hole (2,599 sample) information base (Zulueta, 2011). The sample database was reviewed by WGM for accuracy in preparation for its previous report for Zinc One (Workman and Breede, 2017) and no issues were identified. Benchmarking at 2% Zn showed that a population of 607 samples exceeded this threshold, averaging 9.1% Zn over a 1.3 m interval. Variography indicated a maximum projection of 30 m from sample data points. A 1.5% zinc cut-off was used for block modelling using a 3x3x3 metre block size which produced the following estimate of Mineral Resources (Table 10). The cut-off was prefaced on a US$1,400 per tonne zinc price with no credits for lead or silver. For comparative purposes, the resources are also shown using higher cut-offs of 3% and 4% zinc. It is important to note that this estimate is historical and insufficient work has been done by WGM to confirm the accuracy of these resources and whether they are a representative expression of the mineralization. Certainly the in-put (variables) used by Zulueta for Cristal differ from those which WGM has employed for estimating the current Mineral Resources on Zinc One\u2019s Bongar\u00e1 property.\n",

It\u2019s stratigraphic setting, in the lowermost part of the Pucar\u00e1 stratigraphy, is typical of such deposits on a global basis and underscores the basic requirements for such deposits: (1) a large basin into which metal-bearing sediments are deposited; (2) a protracted history of subsidence leading to the development of complex fault systems; (3) the evolution of metal-bearing brines as a result of compaction and heat flow in the deep basin; and, (4) chemically receptive host rocks. Metallogenesis typically involves the expulsion of weakly acidic, metal-bearing brines from deep in the basin as a result of sediment load and compaction. These fluids, which are typically at the low end of the hydrothermal temperature range, typically ascend permeable faults zones that develop during basin subsidence and base metal sulphides are deposited as the fluids interact with the first permeable and chemically reactive rocks they encounter. Metal sulphide deposition in some instances is attributed to the interaction of heated metal-bearing fluids with lower temperature, reduced sulphate-bearing formational waters that trigger sulphide precipitation.\n",

            "A figure produced by AMEC (Cinits, 2007) based on an interpretation by Anglo Peruana Terra (2005) shows that the Bongar\u00e1 area is located in an area of intersection between an extensional N-trending rift (graben) and a northwest-trending structural corridor within which the basement is dissected by block faults. The concept follows similar models for other basins that globally host MVT deposits. The actual setting may be a bit more complicated in detail, however the figure does follow WGM\u2019s general view that the basement (Maranon Complex) was rifted as part of the initial graben development. That tectonic setting is extensional (transtensional) and resulted in a trough with a general northerly trend. As the basin floor subsided under the weight of accumulating sediments (the Pucar\u00e1 Group), point to point differences in the amount of accumulated sediments produced differential movement, the accumulating stress being relieved by the cross-structures. at some point, compaction and heat resulted in pressure gradients that drove metal-bearing fluids along the surface of the Marahon towards the basin margins. The fluids moved around impermeable blocks and entered permeable conduits that channeled the solutions. Structural intersections were simply more permeable, so these have important ramifications insofar as the localization of deposits, but deposit formation still required a permeable and reactive host rock. Opportune settings, such as in the Bongar\u00e1-Cristal area (Figure 6) obviously included intersections with the Chambar\u00e1 and Condorsinga Formations.\n",
            "\n",
            "The reality is that the geology is much more complicated when viewed in detail. After formation of the Pucar\u00e1 Basin (proto-basin), the area underwent compression and this resulted in folding and reverse faulting which has greatly complicated the geological model and made more difficult the predictability of where favourable Chambar\u00e1 and Condorsinga rocks are located. However, one benefit of this is that the structural complexity has created additional pathways for fluids and this is probably one of the reasons that zinc prospects are so common in the area.\n",
            "\n",
            "The circular features noted on Anglo Peruana Terra's regional geology map are interesting when viewed on Google Earth imagery. As compelling as many of these features are, some of them are much less visible and verge on the imaginary. The overall circular phenomenon is unexplained. It could be the result of doming which in itself might suggest the presence of an intrusion, either magmatic or salt) at some depth below the surface. However, there is no evidence of which WGM is aware of any such rock in the area.\n",

This has direct implications on where best to explore for Mississippi Valley- Type deposits since favourable host rock formations may undergo significant facies variations over short distances. In general, the favoured setting for such mineralization occurs in a permeable limestone member overlying impermeable or non-carbonate strata, and in an area where fault structures have acted as permeable conduits to allow the ascent of metal-bearing waters expelled from deep basin sources. Generally, but not always, such deposits are found near basin margins. Examples of oxide-type zinc deposits of which WGM is knowledgeable that are similar in setting to Bongar\u00e1 include Jabali in Yemen, Jabal Dhayran in Saudi Arabia, Tekneli in Turkey, Esperanza and Torlon in Guatemala, Accha in Peru and Mehdiabad in Iran.\n",

            "A common theme in the setting of all such deposits is that most often the mineralization within a district occurs within the same formation and in approximately the same stratigraphic position. Local factors play a strong role in localizing mineralization, and within a mineral district variations may occur as facies changes and structures exert influences on the migration of fluids (primary and secondary permeability factors). However, the reactivity of the country rocks, including connate and formation waters, to mineral-bearing fluids remains the single most important factor influencing mineralization. It is somewhat surprising, therefore, that mineralization in the greater Bongar\u00e1 area occurs over a wide range of stratigraphy ranging from the middle Chambar\u00e1 Formation (Florida Canyon) to the upper Chambar\u00e1 Fm.

            "Mineralogy Lithology and Structure Mina Grand\u00e9 Sur The best mineralization in this area is found in the most northern part of the sector where a highly Zn-mineralized body is located in dolomitized limestones. These rocks have a sandy silt and clayey silt texture with abundant Fe- oxides. The minerals observed consist mainly of hydrozincite that fills cavities and fractures, and smithsonite which is disseminated in the rock. Another important feature of this mineralization is the presence of hydrozincite in fractures within fresh gray limestone. This occurrence is mainly observed at the end of the mineralized zones or on their margins. Areas south of this zone are typically mantos, generally <10 metres thick, The host lithology in this area is mainly the dolomitized limestone and silty clays. The footwall of the mineralized zone is well defined by a sharp change to massive gray mudstone-type limestone (micrite). The footwall shows no indications of zinc mineralization but it does contain calcite veining as well as patches of calcite. This is thought to represent the product of calcium depletion in the overlying dolomitized host rocks by acidic solutions created during the oxidation of sphalerite. Mina Grand\u00e9 Centro Mineralogy: in this zone the zinc mineralization is mostly in silty clays that are in filling possible karst cavities and forming small zinc-bearing bodies that maintain a NW-SE direction. The main zinc mineral in this area is smithsonite which occurs in silt-clay bodies and hydrozincite that occurs as open space fillings in dolomitized limestones. This particular area is characterized by the presence of an uppermost zone of iron oxides (gossan) that overlies the zinc mineralization as well as small iron oxide-rich bodies that are interspersed with the siltstone, dolomitized clay and limestone. These iron-oxide bodies generally do not contain Zn mineralization. The mineralization is mainly found in silty clays and in small zones in dolomitized limestones. The presence of bodies of iron oxides (gossan) in this area is the result of the oxidation and dissolution of pyrite that originally existed in the limestone. The sulphuric acid generated during this process was a fundamental by- product that resulted in the dissolution of zinc sulphides, and to a lesser extent lead sulphides. These metals were carried short distances in solution that deposited zinc and lead-carbonate and other oxidized mineral species as a result of the buffering effects of the host limestones which were dolomitized in the process. Mina Grand\u00e9 Nort\u00e9 Zinc mineralization in this area occurs in silty brown clays, as well as in strongly fractured and dolomitized limestone with continuously mineralized sections over many metres. The area may be unique in the presence of a porous gray limestone that may be part of the roof of a karst cavity system containing clay-silt material with slightly dolomitized gray limestone clasts and smithsonite mineralization as veins in fractures and as cavity fillings. Smithsonite also occurs as a fine grained replacement with interspersed grains of oxidized sandy-silt textured material and rock fragments. The main zinc-bearing section is underlain by less mineralized and dolomitized limestone that transitions downwards into slightly dolomitized gray limestone containing calcite veinlets and patches that show no evidence of zinc mineralization. The mineralization is mainly found in silty clays and intensely weathered dolomitized limestones. The main Zn mineral in this zone is smithsonite in silt-clay material and hydrozincite that occurs as fracture fillings and replacements of the dolomitized limestone host rocks.

This may have been a factor in the development of mineralization higher in the carbonate sequence than might normally be expected, especially at Bongar\u00e1 and Cristal. On a global basis, many other MVT deposits are in sequences or basins that are producers of oil and gas (e.g. Jabali) or include hydrocarbon- bearing strata (e.g. Gays River, Nova Scotia, Canada).\n",

A similar cross section for the Cristal prospect area is given in Figure 9. Even in deep basins where evidence of such structures may not be visible on surface due to the masking effects of over-lying or younger units, the faults that delineate horst and grabens (sub-basins) in the basement and lower basin strata play an irreplaceable role in the mineralizing process such as at Nanisivik (Canada) and Oued Mekta (Morocco). Fault movement in most cases was protracted beginning with initial basin development and continuing in lock-step with sedimentation and basinal subsidence. Movement on the faults that were conduits may continue long after mineralization such as at Navan (Ireland) where reactivation of pre-existing basement structures resulted in the orebody being broken into several individual sulphide bodies. Many deposits, such as Jabali, are localized where multiple fault structures intersect favourable host rocks, in this case a reef facies limestone.\n",

            "The Bongar\u00e1 area is marked by moderate folding of the stratigraphic section and strong north- westerly striking, basin-parallel fault development (listric faults). These faults tend to have great lateral continuity and control the course of many of the rivers in this area. Taken to their logical roots, these faults mark the boundaries of impermeable blocks of basement rock (grabens and horsts) that were probably instrumental in channelling evolved metal-bearing formational fluids. The Alto Cristal area is one such up-lifted block of Maranon Complex basement. Strong basin-normal, north to northeast faulting is present in the Bongar\u00e1-Cristal area. These faults are younger than and offset the northwest-trending structures, and tend not to have the same lateral continuity as those other faults. With waning movement over time, many of these terminate in the rocks overlying the Condorsinga Fm. The Bongar\u00e1 and Cristal areas are cut by many such faults which likely provided ample conduits for mineralization. WGM observed several faults cutting the mine workings at Mina Grand\u00e9 including a 073o (ENE) fault in the centre of Mina Grand\u00e9 B (Plate 5) and a possible NW-trending mineralized fault in the colluvium area southeast of Mina Grand\u00e9 A near the base of the slope also known as Mina Grand\u00e9 C (Plate 6).\n",

            "Aside from chemical and structural traps represented by reactive limestone formations, sulphur-bearing formational waters and permeable structures, other important local factors that may govern the apparent distribution of mineralization are consequences of the complex folding and faulting patterns in the greater Bongar\u00e1 area. While the Condorsinga Fm. is widely exposed, and all or nearly all of its stratigraphic section is revealed, several important factors are made clear in a detailed geological map of the Cristal Prospect (Anglo Peruana SA). The lowermost member of the Condorsinga Fm. is not well exposed as it wedges out against the ESE-trending South Farallon Fault (see Figure 3). The Chambar\u00e1 Fm. does not outcrop in the area although it presumably underlies the Aramachay Fm. Mineralization is confined to the middle member of the Condorsinga Fm. and is apparently absent in the upper member. This stratigraphic control explains the discontinuous distribution of zinc anomalies in pits and trenches distributed along the trend of the Cristal Prospect \u2013 these showings are located in windows (inliers) through the upper member of the Condorsinga. Given the shallow to moderate dips of the host rocks, it is clear that topography exerts a strong control on the distribution of geochemical anomalies and the interpretation of geochemical data must take this into account in the wider area including Mina Grand\u00e9. Hence, the apparent NW alignment of prospects is in part due to the combined effects of topography and bedding orientation.\n",

            "Although sulphide mineralization is absent in the Bongar\u00e1 area due to weathering and oxidation effects, zinc-lead-silver mineralization is thought to conform to the general provisions of the Mississippi Valley-Type (\u201cMVT\u201d) model for stratabound, carbonate-hosted deposits. These epigenetic deposits occur in all regions of the earth, and in many areas they Hypogene sulphide occur in clusters that define significant mineralized districts. mineralization typically occurs in platform sequence rocks associated with extensional basins. Major MTV districts include the Silesia of eastern Europe, the Viburnum Trend in SE Missouri, the Pine Point area in Canada\u2019s Northwest Territories and the Tri-State area in the United States. According to the US Geological Survey, the median deposit size of 7.0 Mt grading 6% zinc, 1.9% lead, 0.23% copper and 32.5 g silver per tonne. The main ore minerals comprising these deposits are sphalerite and galena, and they are associated with pyrite and marcasite. Gangue minerals include dolomite and calcite, the former being intimately associated with the mineralizing process. Calcite may occur in the form of aragonite veins. Barite may be present in some deposits although it is typically minor.\n",
            "\n",
            "In many parts of the world, MVT deposits in whole or in part have been subject to oxidation due to the effects of oxygenated groundwaters. This commonly occurs in areas that have been significantly up-lifted. For example, the Jabal Dhaylan deposit on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Red Sea coast has been elevated by several hundred metres (or more) as a result of the opening of the Red Sea during the Miocene. Uplift in the Bongar\u00e1 area, situated near the margin of the Pucar\u00e1 Basin in Peru, and the effects of oxidation of the sulphide mineralization, has resulted in the destruction of all hypogene sulphides. In particular, the oxidation of sphalerite generated acidic solutions that allowed zinc to be transported and redeposited as zinc- carbonate and associated mineralization in dolomitized limestones, probably only a very short distance from the original mineralization. In some cases, the non-sulphide mineralization may replace pre-existing sulphides virtually in-situ. Galena is also affected by the oxidation process, and very little evidence is found of the original lead-sulphide mineralization at Bongar\u00e1.\n",

It\u2019s stratigraphic setting, in the lowermost part of the Pucar\u00e1 stratigraphy, is typical of such deposits on a global basis and underscores the basic requirements for such deposits: (1) a large basin into which metal-bearing sediments are deposited; (2) deep burial resulting in Eh, pH, temperature and salinity conditions favourable for metal enrichment in interstitial fluids, (3) load compaction leading to the expulsion of pore fluids; (4) a protracted history of subsidence leading to the development of complex fault systems; and, (5) permeable and chemically reactive host rocks into which the expelled fluids infiltrated.\n",

            "The deposit forming (metallogenic) process typically involves the expulsion of weakly acidic, metal-bearing brines from deep in the basin as a result of sediment load and compaction. These fluids, which are typically at the low end of the hydrothermal temperature range, may ascend permeable faults zones that develop during basin subsidence and base metal sulphides are deposited as the fluids interact with the first permeable and chemically reactive rocks they encounter. Metal sulphide deposition in some instances is attributed to the interaction of heated metal-bearing fluids with lower temperature, reduced sulphate-bearing formational waters that trigger sulphide precipitation. Subsequent changes in the oxidation state to transform the mineralization from sulphide-dominated species to non-sulphide minerals (carbonates, hydroxides, oxides and silicates) may occur if the sulphide-bearing strata are up- lifted and subjected to a long period of weathering under acid-oxidizing conditions.\n",

The initial phase of work was completed at the end of January, 2018 and comprised topographic surveying, and a search to locate and record the co-ordinates of historical exploration drill hole collars, a task that necessarily included reconciling old grid co-ordinates with an up- dated and more reliable GPS datum (WGS 84). This exploration program included systematically resampling existing trenches and excavating new trenches at Bongarita followed by sampling and test pitting programs at Mina Chica, Mina Grand\u00e9 Sur and Mina Grand\u00e9 Nort\u00e9. In particular, the work at Mina Chica was significant as this area had not been sampled previously and the initial surface exploration focused in an area where WGM had previously identified the existence of stressed vegetation cover. High zinc and iron values in soils can result in a degree of toxicity that impedes the growth of plants and trees. WGM had observed this previously around high-grade prospects in the Cuchumatanes zinc belt near Huehuetenango, Guatemala and saw similarities in the Bongar\u00e1 area.\n",

The drilling was completed in three target areas: Mina Grand\u00e9, Mina Chica and Bongarita. The field work component of the exploration program was completed when the last holes were logged and sampled on 30 September, 2018.

            "During the geological logging process, sections of drill core that were identified as being potentially mineralized were identified by marking the beginning and end of each sample and by marking a cutting line along the core axis. In general, sample intervals are 1.5 metres in length, however sample intervals do not cross geological contacts or major changes in alteration style or mineralization and therefore some samples may be greater or less than this length. to ensure that the sample taken was representative of the core, the cutting line was generally positioned such that it was along the axial plane or normal to any structure in the core. A pre-numbered sample tag was affixed to the core tray at the end point of each sample. In intervals where the drill core was broken, a cutting line was drawn on only those fragments of core that were sufficiently large to justify cutting. On completion of the logging, the drill core was sawn in half with a diamond saw. One half of the core was returned to the core tray and retained as archival core. The other half was placed in a plastic sample bag together with a duplicate pre-numbered sample tag, and sealed with tape.

Zinc One selected outcrop material to produce standards with three distinct zinc contents, and the material was crushed and homogenized in a geochemical laboratory. Sub-sets of each of the three standards were submitted to multiple laboratories for repetitive analysis and the results were compared in such a manner as to ascertain and assign a metal content to each of the Zinc One standards.

            "During its previous visit to the Bongar\u00e1 and Bongarita sites in September, 2014, senior WGM geologist, Al Workman carried out independent sampling of the mineralization and confirmed the location of selected pits, trenches and drill sites. The Mina Grand\u00e9 A, B and C workings, Bongarita and Mina Chica Prospects were examined and sampled over a 3-day period. The Bongar\u00e1 A and B workings and Mina Chica were outlined in detail by GPS track at the time they were sampled. All track and sample location (waypoint) data was collected using the PSAD-56 datum used by the project and imported into Google Earth software. All sites measured by WGM reported an estimated precision error of less than 3 metres. Descriptions of the WGM samples collected during the site visit were provided in a previous WGM technical report. A total of 16 bedrock samples were collected for multi-element analysis by ICP, quantitative ore-grade analysis for Zn, Pb and Ag, and a determination of major elements (oxides) by fusion XRF. Water content data and specific gravity determinations were requested on all samples. The samples were delivered by WGM to the SGS laboratory in Lakefield, Ontario and produced assay result that generally replicated reported values, or certainly the range of zinc values. WGM\u2019s corroboration of drill sites and other features was impeded by survey datum issues relating to the use of the PSAD-56 datum. The WGM geologist had a similar experience with a former client on a drill site in southern Peru, so the problem was not surprising and corrective action required the adoption of the WGS-84 datum.\n",

            "Zinc One was fully informed of the surveying problem affecting some of the historical surveying in the Bongar\u00e1 area and took corrective action immediately by resurveying the terrain, test pits and trenches, and historical drill sites using the WGS-84 datum. As originally believed by WGM, Zinc One\u2019s recent verification work confirmed that the co-ordinates for historical drill holes, pits and trenches within individual prospects or deposits had a reasonable degree of internal (geometric) precision. Consequently, WGM sees no reason for concern insofar as existing resource estimates are made for individual prospects/deposits such as Mina Grand\u00e9, Mina Chica or elsewhere.\n",

            "The Bongar\u00e1 deposit (A and B faces) is hosted in a variety of rocks in the Condorsinga Fm. which are generally very fine grained, grey limestones that have been variably dolomitized. They are described in the literature as being micritic, i.e. lithified carbonate muds and ooze. The shallowly dipping (10o-30o) bedding is typically a metre or less in thickness. No clear evidence was seen of fossils in the mine workings however a few 1-5 cm brachiopods were observed along the Bongar\u00e1 access road. Some mineralized limestone in the \u2018Mina Grand\u00e9 C\u2019 area had features reminiscent of coral reef. No mineralization is apparent in the upper Condorsinga Fm. or in the Aramachay Fm. which other workers have concluded is unfavourable for mineralization, however as these rocks are limestones and calcareous mudstones, and are locally carbonaceous as well as having reasonably good permeability, no convincing reason is given for their lack of mineralization. The reason may involve the efficient stripping of metals from up-welling solution by the underlying Chambar\u00e1 or Condorsinga formations.\n",
            "\n",
            "The mineralization in MVT deposits is typically accompanied by a substantial amount of pyrite formation commonly making it the most abundant sulphide mineral. The oxidation of MVT deposits therefore releases a large amount of Fe-oxides and this iron pervasively colours the host rocks in a large volume within which the base metal mineralization is enclosed.\n",

All carbonates in and around the Mina Grand\u00e9 Centro and Nort\u00e9 zones are buff to yellow-brown coloured due to the tropical weathering on Fe-bearing rocks. Mina Grand\u00e9 Nort\u00e9 is partially overlain by a goethite-rich ferricrete the age of which is uncertain. Angular, cm-scale fragments of goethite are locally cemented by hydrozincite creating a mosaic-style breccia that may be genetically related to late movement on easterly trending faults that cut the deposit (Plate 7). This iron may be an anomaly as it was not observed at Mina Chica (also known as Bongarita), and no specific mention is made of such ferricrete mineralization elsewhere in the Bongar\u00e1-Cristal mineral belt.\n",

Interestingly, boulders on the road to Mina Chica contain brachiopod fossils up to 5 cm in size suggesting shallow water deposition. A weak pervasive reaction to zinc zap is seen locally in the trenches that typically indicates a zinc content of \u00b1500 ppm. Some of these rocks contain vuggy calcite veinlets that give a moderate reaction. The local geologist reported that such rocks are typical of the lower Chambar\u00e1 Fm., however the rocks in the area are reportedly Condorsinga Fm. the Mina Chica area has been trenched in many areas and strong zinc zap reactions are noted.

Metre- scale boulders are common. The \u201csoil\u201d that is present contains a high percentage of limestone and dolostone fragments and the finer fractions give a strong zinc-zap reaction.

            "Time did not permit WGM to complete an extensive on-site review of the geological setting of all zones during 2014, however the return visits in 2017 and 2018 did allow for a more complete review of the mineralization in the Mina Chica, Mina Grand\u00e9 Centro and Mina Grand\u00e9 Sur areas. At the time of its original 2014 site visit, WGM had predicted the existence of a major zone of mineralization at Mina Chica, and Zinc One\u2019s exploration has confirmed this. A good understanding of the local geology, including the differences between the three zones is fundamental to understanding the metallogeny, but it is also vital to assessing exploration potential. Mineralization is hosted in the Condorsinga Fm., the highest member of the Pucar\u00e1 Group. Torres (2010) depicts the BB' cross-section wherein the host rocks and the Mina Grand\u00e9 anticline are up-lifted and eroded exposing the Condorsinga Fm. Torres believes that the mineralization should continue on the limbs of the anticline, especially the north-eastern limb, below the overlying Sarayaquillo Formation and that this mineralization is more likely to be primary sulphides. Torres believes that the \u201cYambrasbamba reverse fault\u201d, shown as the Chiriaco Fault on the drawings included in this report, may have influenced mineralization. Torres concluded that the prospectivity of this belt is upheld by the occurrence of multiple zinc occurrences to the northwest at Campo Cielo, Cristal and Alto Cristal. Thus far, Zinc One has found no evidence to dispute Torres\u2019 assessment of the exploration potential.\n",

Torres believes that Chambar\u00e1 limestone is an important host to mineralization and has potential for primary sulphide mineralization.

Diamond drilling did extend the mineralization to a depth of 27 m from surface, well below what could be trenched manually. However some of this mineralization was stacked and excluded from the resources due to intervening horizons of weak mineralization. In some cases, the trenches and pits terminated in low grade mineralization directly above levels that were well mineralized.

The high composition of hemimorphite in the samples, with smithsonite being absent in 80% of the test pits, suggests that the samples were somewhat subjectively acquired or that the samples were collected from a highly weathered zone in which smithsonite was largely replaced by hydrozincite and hemimorphite. Prior to site remediation, WGM observed good evidence for smithsonite in the Mina Grand\u00e9 pit walls, and this appears to be the least weathered type of zinc mineralization.\n",

A suggestion is made that hemimorphite replaces wurtzite however this is doubtful in the opinion of WGM as no wurtzite is observed or reported at Bongar\u00e1. The habit of hemimorphites at Bongar\u00e1 is similar to that in many other locations in both tropical and arid environments, simply that it appears late in the paragenesis as a void-filling phase, commonly growing as spectacular fine-grained sprays of crystals lining dissolution cavities that are found along fractures and shears in the host limestone.\n",

It is certainly younger (later) than smithsonite.\n",

This deposit is similar in some respects to Bongar\u00e1, but contains a greater amount of original sulphide mineralization. Nevertheless, something can be learned from the Votorantim experience. AMEC was retained during 2013 to evaluate the project at the scoping level, now referred to as a \u201cPreliminary Economic Assessment\u201d. The Florida Canyon sulfide resource was shown to consist of zinc and lead sulfides in a limestone matrix where zinc is in higher proportions than lead. The beneficiation testing focused on conventional lead-zinc flotation. The oxide resource contains zinc in much higher proportion than lead, and consists of zinc carbonates and zinc silicates in a dolomitic limestone matrix. In contrast to the work by Kalinaj at Bongar\u00e1, the zinc-oxide material was found to be predominately smithsonite and hemimorphite together with a lead-oxide material (cerussite). The oxide recovery process Smallvill investigated focused on a combination of heavy media separation (HMS) followed by conventional zinc-oxide flotation.

This targeting approach is possible due to the flay-lying to very shallowly dipping orientation of the mineralized bodies. Vertical and angled drill holes from surface vary greatly in direction, and consequently drill holes from different drill pads often converge at depth.

More recent sampling, including the Zinc One surface and drill hole samples, determined Zn, Pb and Ag as part of a multi-element ICP package for all samples, followed by additional quantitative analyses, repeated if necessary, to determine zinc contents in those samples for which the initial results exceeded the detection limit. In Appendix 1, the results of Exploratory Data Analyses (\u201cEDA\u201d) include results for Pb and Ag but those elements are not included in the resource estimates. In addition to the fact that some holes contained many samples that exceeded the detection limit for lead and a few samples exceeded that for silver, Zinc One has indicated to WGM that in its opinion the economic recovery of lead and silver is doubtful given the anticipated ore processing route. For these reasons, WGM moved forward with a zinc-only Mineral Resource estimate.\n",

WGM determined that the surface sample averages were sufficiently similar to those of the drilling to allow their inclusion for Inferred Resource estimates.

A summary of sample statistics by type for all of the zones on the Bongar\u00e1 property is presented in Table 32. The samples described below are all within the constraining wireframes used for the resource estimates. As the surface sampling and BO series drilling appear to have been targeted more specifically to test mineralized areas, and as the Zinc One drilling was more systematically done on a grid to test known mineralization and to potentially enlarge the outer margins of these zones, the apparent bias may be due to hole location and target selection.

The wireframes were based on polylines interpreted on a series of vertical sections at various orientations, as well as on plan views using 5 m elevation separations. The polyline interpretations were based on both Zn assay grades and lithology. An approximate grade boundary of 5% Zn was used as that represented a level of mineralization below the cut-off grade used for the block model resource estimates. Zinc One provided manual interpretations of both lithology and Zn mineralization on hard copy prints of drill and surface sample data projected to vertical sections to be used as a guide to assist WGM with its modelling.

This was judged to be the best approach for developing a means of constraining the resources due to the very irregular distribution of metal, and the lack of a clear grade or geologically defined outer border to the mineralization that could be used as a hard boundary to constrain the resources.

            "The grade interpolation used the values as described previously from the composited sample data. All of the diamond drilling in Mina Chica was undertaken by Zinc One and in general it is more evenly spaced and systematic than the drilling carried out elsewhere. There is no apparent development of low-grade gossan overprinting the zinc mineralization. However, in common with the other zones of zinc mineralization, there is also a very irregular distribution of metal content and the lack of a clear grade or geological border outer controlling the mineralization that could easily be used as a hard boundary to constrain the mineral resources. The lower boundary and eastern limit of the Mina Chica zone is marked by a regional thrust fault that strikes north-northwest and dips shallowly to the southwest. Further, there are numerous sub-vertical faults that cut the zone and appear to have had horizontal and vertical displacements of several metres or more along them.\n",
            "\n",
            "The geometry of the mineralized zone, as a series of adjacent fault-bounded blocks, was deduced using the interpreted faults to better define the limits of the zinc mineralization. Statistical analyses showed there to be no significant differences in zinc mineralization between these blocks. As the exact location of the faults was uncertain, they were not used as hard boundaries limiting interpolation. Figure 16 is a 3D view showing the Mina Chica constraining wireframe with the four interpreted fault blocks depicted with different colours.\n",

            "The 5% Zn value in assays, in conjunction with lithological units where logged, were used with the assumption that the cut-off value for the resources would be approximately twice the value used for the shell. This approach is consistent with that used for the Mina Grand\u00e9 zones. The areas to the north and northwest of Mina Chica have not been sampled by drilling, and therefore the limits of mineralization are not entirely clear in this area. The area to the north and west of drill hole MCH-18-035 is particularly interesting as this is the last hole drilled in that area and it contains in excess of 20% zinc over a 30 metre interval from 29.8 m to 59.8 m.\n",

Diagenetic and mineralizing fluids migrated along structures and stratigraphic units with favorable porosity and permeability. The deposit consists of multiple ellipsoid-shaped mineralized bodies that are stacked within a vertical interval of more than 100 metres. Manto zones are 1-9 m thick and occur over an area of about 1 km by 3 km. Unmineralized gaps exist within the mineralized manto zones, as is typical for hydrothermal replacement deposits. Irregular steeply dipping replacement bodies also occur frequently at the intersection of vein-like feeder structures and in karst-controlled mineralization. The deposit has been drilled at depths of up to 450 m below surface. Zinc mineralization occurs as massive sphalerite, locally oxidized to smithsonite and hemimorphite whereas lead occurs as galena that is oxidized to cerussite and anglesite.\n",

            "Zinc mineralization in the Bongar\u00e1 area is hosted within the Pucar\u00e1 Basin of western Peru, an elongate trough that extends more than 1,000 km and the entire length of the country along a NNW trend. The basin evolved during the Mesozoic associated with NW-striking sinistral shearing that controlled the development of internal structure, basin depth and facies distributions. The basin is host to a large number of zinc deposits and prospects that conform to the Mississippi Valley-type (\u201cMVT\u201d) model. Badoux et al (2001) relate the mineralization to metal-enriched basinal brines that were expelled from the deeper basin during late Andean orogenesis. These fluids preferentially circulated in permeable zones along bedding planes and brittle fracture/fault conduits, and deposited base metals sulphides in permeable and reactive carbonate host strata. Badoux specifically studied the San Vicente deposit in central Peru, however his fundamental findings are also applicable to the Bongar\u00e1 area.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Bongar\u00e1 mineralization conforms in most respects to a carbonate-replacement mechanism and the MVT model is seemingly the most appropriate. However, this type of mineralization almost always is located at or near the base of the host limestone formation and yet the mineralization identified to date in the Bongar\u00e1 area is located well above the base of the Pucar\u00e1 Group. Local evidence suggests potential for mineralization at lower levels in the stratigraphic column. Much of this could be in the form of sulphide ore located below the limit of surface weathering (oxidation).\n",
            "\n",
            "The geological and metallogenic model for the Bongar\u00e1 area is well enunciated in many of the project reports, and supports the potential for additional zinc deposits in the Bongar\u00e1 area, both oxide-type and sulphide-type, near surface and at depth. A wide range of formations are potential hosts including the Condorsinga Fm. in the upper part of the Pucar\u00e1 Group and the Chambar\u00e1 Fm. in its lower part. Mineralization is associated with strong dolomitization of the host rocks.\n",

While there is no guarantee that the Bongar\u00e1 area will exhibit similar mineral potential, it is noteworthy given its proximity and shared geological characteristics, and especially since MVT-type deposits tend to occur in open clusters. Other occurrences in the area, many of which are no more than geochemical anomalies are thus highly prospective exploration targets.\n",

            "With the exception of a historical drilling program carried out during 2011 in the Cristal area, no recent exploration has been completed on the Charlotte Bongar\u00e1 concessions since 2005. Until the recent work by Zinc One that is the subject of this report, no exploration had been carried out on the Bongar\u00e1 concessions since the previous limited mining operation during 2007-08. There is clear evidence for zones of additional mineralization extending to the northwest through Mina Chica and Campo Cielo, and extending at least as far as the Cristal prospects, a distance of as least 7 km. There are also opportunities for additional zones of mineralization to be found at depth. Additional exploration is clearly justified beginning with the major centres of mineralization as noted above.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the past, the exploration of the Bongar\u00e1, Mina Chica, Campo Cielo, Cristal and other prospects has relied on surface sampling (stream sediments, soils, rocks) for initial prospecting purposes to identify target areas. In the March 2011 report on Campo Cielo, the authors concluded that the recent exploration work (292 pit samples, 15 channel samples and 69 trench samples) identified the limestone horizon and the dolomitic alteration within it that could be used as a guide to future exploration. The goal of the proposed follow-up work was to extend the mineralized zone on the eastern end of Mina Chica towards Mina Grand\u00e9. In the Campo Cielo area, the hosting role of the upper limestone member of the Condorsinga Formation was recognized, a unit that dips 70o NE on the north-eastern flank of the eroded Bongar\u00e1 Anticline. The principle economic minerals were described as smithsonite, hemimorphite and \u201ca complex mixture of zinc oxides\u201d.\n",
            "\n",
            "The identification of targets for follow-up exploration has been reasonably simple due to the strength of the zinc and lead anomalies detected. Examples include Campo Cielo, Cristal and San Jos\u00e9. The follow-up exploration tends to consist of hand-dug pits, usually about one square metre in area, but occasionally much larger (>2x3 m) where deeper surficial cover is present. These pits, and more extensive trenches that have followed on some anomalies, have provided multiple samples over a vertical or horizontal profile, and when closely spaced have allowed the continuity of mineralization in both vertical and horizontal planes to be assessed, even providing for preliminary volumetric calculations of Mineral Resources. It is worth noting that not all anomalies have been attributed to bedrock sources on some of the Charlotte Bongar\u00e1 licenses (eg. at Alto Nort\u00e9), and additional follow-up geochemical work needs to be done to vector towards the bedrock source.\n",

            "surveying under consideration has included magnetic, electromagnetic (\u201cEM\u201d), resistivity- induced polarization (\u201cIP\u201d) and gravity surveying. However, the relatively unresponsive character of non-sulphide zinc-lead mineralization means that the anomalies detected, if any, will be very subtle with the possible exception of gravity anomalies. Given the depth of weathering in the Bongar\u00e1 area, the presence of sulphides within 100 m of surface is unlikely except in river valleys where the rate of erosion is sufficiently high to remove oxidized mineralization. Even here, however, the major ore minerals sphalerite and galena are nonmagnetic and nonpolarizable, and so no not respond well to conventional geophysical techniques. Pyrite, which is ubiquitous in MVT-type deposits does produce excellent IP chargeability anomalies, however no such mineralization has been seen at Bongar\u00e1. Whether oxide-type or sulphide, larger deposits also produce strong, if localized, gravity anomalies however this surveying technique tends to be very expensive as it requires very precise 3D topographic control. Gravity surveying is rarely a technique of first choice to be applied over a large rugged area.\n",
            "\n",
            "From a pragmatic perspective, diamond drilling has been the follow-up method of choice for exploring targets based on geochemical anomalies. Given the largely in-situ nature of the anomalies associated with mineralization, definitive geochemical surveys have led directly to diamond drilling. Given the near-surface setting of the mineralization at Mina Grand\u00e9 and Cristal, the drilling programs have utilized a short-hole approach, typically drilling vertical holes to a depth of less than 100 m.\n",

Kalinaj objected to this approach saying that the lithology database was not representative given the collection methods used, and that the use of a universal tonnage conversion factor within such a deposit was inappropriate given the variations observed in the mineralization. WGM agrees with this and furthermore agrees with Kalinaj\u2019s solution of acquiring specific gravity data on a much larger sample population base. The data should be collected from representative lithologies in each drill hole before the core is chemically analysed. WGM believes that the best method to model the deposit is to use such data to assign a specific gravity (density factor) to every sample in each hole, and to effectively produce a density model for the deposit. The S.G. database must contain data on the full range of assay values in the deposit and in all lithologies.

The company recommended an exploration program of diamond drilling to explore below the known areas of mineralization and to cautiously extend these zones outwards through contouring the zinc values, karst features, dolomitization etc., as isolines to guide the planning of future exploration drill holes. WGM strongly recommends the use of metal content contouring, for example as grade \u2013 thickness isolines, as a means of detecting trends in the mineralization. A low cut-off should be tried, for example 1% Zn, to ensure the contours reflect the total metal \u2018budget\u2019 in the host formation.

The fact that the high-silica samples were well mineralized with 37.7% to 43.5% Zn as well as lead values, indicates the presence of a permeable, shallow-water facies that may explain the presence of mineralization this high in the stratigraphic succession. WGM concluded that facies may play an important role in mineralization in the Condorsinga Fm. and that detailed geological mapping may allow favourable sections to be identified. The single 7 metre channel sample at Mina Grand\u00e9 Sur that carried 43.1% Zn and 1.13% Pb also contained 11.8% SiO2 was in a rock that exhibited reef-like primary textures that also indicate shallow-water conditions.\n",

Breccias often exhibit dissolution features because they are permeable structures, however, the degree of karstification may be restricted to the structure alone. This is not the same as widespread karstification. WGM saw no evidence of large collapse features or out-flow zones as might be expected if karst was widely developed. Furthermore, karst is not widely represented within the sample population that has a combined zinc plus lead content exceeding 3%. Zones of karst do occur in nearly every drill hole, but WGM suspects that the term is broadly applied to any zone that is not well recovered by the drillers, however whether it is an actual karst cavity may be quite different. Karst is noted within mineralized sections however it also occurs somewhat above or below zones that are mineralized giving its distribution a more random relationship with mineralization.\n",

If these areas can be acquired by Zinc One, additional exploration should be based on conventional soil and stream sediment sampling. WGM recommends the use of an auger to sample consistently at 1-metre depths on a grid using 50-metre stations on 100-metre spaced profile lines normal to the trend of the zone. The samples should be collected consistently from the lower 10 cm of the holes and analysed using and ICP-based multi-element geochemical package that includes base metals, silver and the major indicator elements. All anomalies should be followed up with test pits to allow sampling to be carried out to identify vertical geochemical profiles. In the extensive area surrounding San Jose, stream sediment sampling is probably a more practical and cost- effective means of initial geochemical coverage.

The company is also engaged directly with the Government in acquiring approvals for the construction of pads for drill sites. This requires the approval of an environmental instrument called a Technical Sustaining Instrument (\u201cITS\u201d) that includes a mine closure plan. A modification to this plan was required to give the company approval to explore in the previously disturbed and now remediated terrain.\n",

            "Zinc One has been proactive in engaging with local residents and should continue to do so to ensure that Zinc One and local inhabitants and their representatives are aware of each other\u2019s concerns and that Zinc One has the opportunity to mitigate adverse impacts. Many exploration companies have found a ready and willing workforce in the local villages close to exploration sites. As Zinc One\u2019s work is mainly drilling in brownfields areas that are not treaty land or land subject to a land claim, WGM understands that very little consultative work may actually be required.\n",
