Suite 830 - 1100 Melville Street Vancouver, British Columbia V6E 4A6\\n\\nR. Tim Henneberry, P.Geo. February 15, 2017 Revised May 8, 2017\\n\\n-2- SUMMARY\\n===\\n\\nThe Bleiberg property consists of 116 exploration licenses totaling 6,582.4 hectares, 130 kilometres southeast of the city of Salzburg, Austria. Tasca Resources Ltd. is earning a 100% interest in 116 exploration licenses from Samarium Borealis Corporation of Vancouver, British Columbia by making a $60,000 cash payment on TSX Venture Exchange approval and a further $60,000 cash payment within two years of TSX Venture Exchange approval. There are no additional payments or royalties.\\n\\nThe Bleiberg property is one of four major lead zinc deposits associated with the Periadriatic Lineament, a regional suture stretching from Italy through Austria and Slovenia to Romania. These deposits are hosted in Triassic lagoonal sediments. In the Bleiberg area these consist of the Wetterstein Formation, a dolomitic carbonate platform and the overlying Raibl Group, an alternating sequence of three 10 to 40 metre thick terrigenous clastic and 30 to 70 metre thick carbonate evaporate units. Mineralization is largely confined to the upper 60 metres of the 300 metre thick Wetterstein Formation and the first or lowermost carbonate evaporate unit in the overlying Raibl Group. Mineralization consists of classic stratabound mineralization in the upper 60 metres of the Wetterstein; the Kalkscholle, Josefischolle, Riedhardscholle breccia bodies also in the upper Wetterstien; and stratabound mineralization in the overlying Raibl Formation.\\n\\nTasca Resources Ltd. has yet to undertake any exploration on the Bleiberg property as this technical report is provided to support its acquisition. The Bleiberg mine ran from the 1300\\'s through to 1993, when it closed as part of a larger bankruptcy of the Austrian state owned mining conglomerate.\\n\\nThe Bleiberg property is a project of merit and further exploration is warranted. The initial step will be a review and compilation of the voluminous historical data. This will need to be accomplished in Austria as the data is stored in country at various government agencies throughout the country. The objective of the program will be to confirm the volume of unmined mineralized material remaining and to define targets for initial exploration, expected to consist of underground drilling.\\n\\nA two phase exploration program is recommended for the Bleiberg project. The first phase is a first pass review of the voluminous exploration data at the various government agencies in Austria. This will require two experienced Canadian geologists with some mining production experience to undertake the review. An experienced Austrian geologist somewhat fluent in English will also be required to translate both in Austrian government offices and the documents and maps in German. This is estimated to cost $200,000.\\n\\nThe second stage will consist of first pass underground drilling in the order of 1,500 metres, at an all in estimated cost of $340,000.\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bleiberg Project\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"February 2017\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Mammoth Geological Ltd.\" -->\\n\\n-3- TABLE OF CONTENTS\\n===\\n\\n|||\\n| - | - |\\n| INTRODUCTION | 4 |\\n| RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS | 4 |\\n| PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION | 5 |\\n| ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY | 12 |\\n| HISTORY | 12 |\\n| GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION | 17 |\\n| Mineralization | 19 |\\n| DEPOSIT TYPES | 22 |\\n| EXPLORATION | 23 |\\n| DRILLING | 23 |\\n| SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY | 23 |\\n| DATA VERIFICATION | 24 |\\n| MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING | 24 |\\n| MINERAL RESOURCESAND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES | 25 |\\n| ADJACENT PROPERTIES | 25 |\\n| OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION. | 25 |\\n| INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS | 26 |\\n| RECOMMENDATIONS | 28 |\\n| REFERENCES. | 29 |\\n| CERTIFICATE OF QUALIFIED PERSON | 31 |\\n\\n|||\\n| - | - |\\n| LIST OF FIGURES Figure 1: Project Location ..... | 4 |\\n| Figure 2: Exploration License Locations | 8 |\\n| Figure 3.

MinroG regulates the prospecting, exploration and mining of all mineral raw materials and contains detailed regulations concerning exploration and mining licences, operating plans, mining installations, supervision etc. In addition, there are detailed provisions governing areas where mining is prohibited, as well as provisions on protected areas.\\n\\nOpen-cast mining of grundeigene mineral raw materials (belonging to the owner of the land) is supervised by the District Administration (first instance), appeals against such decisions brought before the Provincial Governor as the second and last instance. All other forms of mineral raw material exploration and mining are administered by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Labour (\"Mining Authority\").\\n\\nAccording to the MinroG, mineral ores are categorised in three groups: bergfreie mineral resources (i.e. free for exploitation by persons who are not necessarily owner of the land on which it is found) (Sec 3 MinroG, e.g. iron, lead, zinc, gold, copper, silver, tungsten, gypsum, anhydrite, graphite, talcum, kaolin, limestone, magnesite, dolerite, oil shale, etc.); bundeseigene mineral resources or state-owned (Sec 4 MinroG, rock salt, hydrocarbon, uranium, thorium) and grundeigene mineral resources i.e. owned by the land owner (all mineral raw materials not listed in Sec 3 and 4 MinroG, e.g. quartz, brick clays, dolomite, marl, feldspar, basaltic rock etc.).\\n\\nThe mere search (without exploration works) for bergfreie and grundeigene mineral raw materials has to be notified to the Mining Authority. At the end of each calendar year a report on the search and its results has to be submitted to the Mining Authority (Sec 6, 7 MinroG).\\n\\nThe exploration of bergfreie mineral raw materials is subject to an exploration licence (Schurjberechtigung) granted by the Mining Authority (Sec 8 MinroG). For the granting of an exploration licence the holder has to pay a fee (Frdschwfgeb\u00fchr) which amounts at present to EUR 8,72 per exploration license.\\n\\nAn exploration licence gives the holder the exclusive right to explore natural resources of bergfreie mineral raw materials for the purpose of determining the worthiness of mining within an area forming a circle with a radius of 425m (Sec 9 para 1 MinroG). For the avoidance of doubt, the term exploration licence means (and is used hereinafter exclusively within this meaning) a licence for the search for bergfreie mineral deposits up to discovery including delineation of the deposits by means of drilling and sampling. An exploration licence gives the holder also the right to exclude the granting of a mining licence to others within a rectangle of 48.000m2 , the central point of which is identical with the central point of the exploration licence circle (Vorbehaltsfeld, i.e. reservation area). The right to a reservation area (one per exploration licence) has to be claimed vis-a-vis the Mining Authority at the latest on the occasion of the in situ hearing for the granting of a mining licence to another patty (Sec 9 para 2 MinroG).\\n\\nThe geographical location of an exploration licence is defined by the coordinates of its central point in the cadastral survey system.\\n\\nAccording to Sec 21 MinroG the holder of an exploration licence acquires ownership to the bergfreie mineral raw materials found during exploration works (with the exception of magnesite, limestone, basaltic minerals, quartz sand and clay). However, this does not include the right to conduct mining operations.\\n\\nIt is not permitted to lease exploration licences to third parties or to have third parties exercise the exploration licences.\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bleiberg Project\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"February 2017\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Mammoth Geological Ltd.\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"-10-\" -->\\n\\nAn exploration licence does not entitle the holder to mining, exploiting, extracting or processing activities. For these activities a mining licence has to be obtained (Bergwerksberechtigung). Holding an exploration licence does not guarantee the granting of a mining licence. The granting of a mining licence is a separate legal proceeding. In order to be granted a mining licence, amongst other conditions the profitable mineability of mineral deposits and sufficient financial funds have to be evidenced to the Mining Authority.\\n\\nAn exploration licence is granted by the Mining Authority upon application for an initial term of the calendar year in which it is granted plus four subsequent years.\\n\\nPrecondition for the prolongation of exploration licences for further 5 years is to perform exploration of mineral raw materials at least once within the 5 years for which the exploration licences have been granted. Performing exploration works in the area of one exploration licence (Freischurf) is sufficient for the prolongation of for up to 100 exploration licences (section 13, para 2 MinroG).\\n\\nAccording to Sec 14 7 MinroG both for prospecting and exploration activities the right to access and use the surface of the land on which prospecting and exploration works are to be carried out has to be obtained from the respective land owners. Such access and usage agreements do not create either rights in rem or registered rights, these are merely agreements under civil law in a two party relationship.\\n\\nPrecondition for performing the exploration works is the submission of a Work Programme to the Mining Authority and its approval by formal written decision. No exploration works may be undertaken without the approval of the Work Programme by the Mining Authority. A Work Programme has to specify in detail the exploration works to be carried out, the time schedule for the works, the exact location of the works undertaken (specifying the exploration licences concerned), the measures to protect the ground surface and the approval of the land owners for the use of their prope1ties. A responsible person has to be nominated who supervises the works and has a permanent residence close to or on the site. Only after the formal approval of the Work Programme by the Mining Authority exploration works may be undertaken. The works have to be in accordance with the approved Work Programme. Changes regarding the area where the works are carried out and substantial changes of the type and extent of the works undertaken require a new approval by decision of the Mining Authority. At the end of each calendar year a report on the works performed and the results has to be submitted to the Mining Authority.\\n\\nIn addition to the Mineralrohstoffgesetz, a number of Jaws, acts and regulations govern impact upon or limit SBC\\'s use of the exploration licences, amongst which are both federal and provincial laws, acts and regulations. Examples are laws and regulations on water protection, worker protection, environmental protection, nature and landscape protection, forestry, land use and zoning.\\n\\nDuring the approval proceedings for a Work Programme, the Mining Authority involves other authorities - both federal and provincial - such as the worker protection, forestry, water protection, environmental and nature protection authorities. These authorities might decide that in addition to the approval from the Mining Authority other approvals might be required or they consent to the works, but stipulate conditions for their execution, or they deny their consent.\\n\\nWhich permits and approvals are required is determined on a case by case basis by the Mining Authority together with the other competent authorities depending on the actual works to be unde1taken, their type (e.g. drilling), extent and the exact area (e.g. in a nature or landscape protection area, in a forestry area) and location (e.g. open cast) where such works are to be effected. Required permits may include forestry law (Forstgesetz) authorisations, authorisations according to the law relating to water protection and water use (Wasserrechtsgesetz) as well as other permits and approvals. In case the exploration area is in a protected area according to Federal Law\\n\\n(Nationalpark) or according to Provincial Law within a Nature Protection Area (Naturschutzgebiet), or Landscape Protection Area (Landschaftschutzgebiet), it is uncertain whether or not exploration works may be performed. In any case, additional permits according to these laws are in most cases required for the performance of exploration works.\\n\\nBleiberg Project\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"February 2017 Mammoth Geological Ltd.\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"-11-\" -->\\n\\nThe mining of bergfreie mineral raw materials is subject to a mining licence (Bergwerksberechtigung) granted by the Mining Authority (Sec 22 MinroG). Mining licences are granted for either a Grubenma\u00df (mining license) or for an \u00dcberschar (Sec 23 no l and 2 MinroG). Both refer to a certain volume of matter for which a mining licence is granted. For the granting of a mining licence the holder has to pay a fee (Ma\u00dfengeb\u00fchr) which amounts at present to EUR 26 per Grubenma\u00df and to EUR 13 per \u00dcberschar. The law entitles the Federal Minister of Economy and Labour in coordination with the Federal Minister of Finance to add a surcharge to the listed amounts as far as such surcharge is necessary to adapt the listed amounts to the changes in the economic environment. In addition to these fees and the surcharges, if any, for the time being there are no other fees or royalties payable to the Authorities for the granting of a mining licence.\\n\\nAs per the DLA Piper Title Opinion, the 116 exploration licenses are registered in good standing in the name of Samarium Borealis Corporation. Tasca Resources Ltd. is earning a 100% interest in the 116 exploration licenses by making a cash payment of $60,000 on TSX Venture Exchange approval and a further payment of $60,000 within two years of TSX Venture Exchange approval. There are no other royalties, back-in rights, payments, or other agreements and encumbrances to which the property is subject according to the Option Agreement.\\n\\nThere are 90 mining licenses registered in the name of GKB-Bergbau GmbH that have prior rights to the exploration licenses as shown in Figure 2. GKB is a company owned by the Austrian government that has been inactive for the last 25 years. They previously ran the Bleiberg until shutdown in 1992. Samarium representatives have had preliminary discussions with GKB representatives about access through the mine to the potential exploration area that appears to lie largely outside of the mining licenses. In addition, there are 7 exploration licenses with prior rights to the Samarium licenses. They appear to be acquired for road construction materials and are registered in the name of Modre Bergbau GmbH. They lie to the southwest of the potential exploration area.\\n\\nTo the best of the author\\'s knowledge, the 116 exploration concessions are not subject to any environmental liabilities. According to the DLA Piper Title Opinion, the 116 exploration licenses are valid until 31-December-2018. Exploration work will need to be completed prior to 31- December-2018 to maintain the 116 exploration licenses in good standing for a further 5 years.\\n\\nAs per the summary of Austrian Mining Law in the DLA Piper Title Opinion, the proposed work program must be submitted to the Mining Authority for approval prior to the commencement of exploration work. Email correspondence with Dr. Winkler of DLA Piper suggests the approval process is 3 to 5 months depending on the complexity of the submission. A submission of a work program has not yet been made to the Mining Authority.\\n\\nThe only other risk to the project is the possibility that individual land owners may not allow access to their land to carry out exploration activities. The planned exploration will be underground drilling so permission from surface land owners will not be required. However, underground access will be required through historic workings to access the target areas. Samarium representatives have been in contact with the company holding the mining leases and Samarium representatives do not foresee any problems obtaining access.\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bleiberg Project\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"February 2017\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Mammoth Geological Ltd.\" -->\\n\\n-12- ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY\\n\\nThe Bleiberg property lies in the Austrian Alps and encompasses the villages of Bleiberg Notch and Bleiberg Kreuth is southwestern Austria. Elevations range from 800 metres in the valley bottom to over 1800 metres at the peaks of the individual mountains. The topography ranges from valley floors through to steeper mountain tops. The areas around the villages are developed, while the lower and middle slopes are forested with deciduous oak and beech forests in some areas and more mixed beech and fir forests and upper slopes more fir, larch and pine.\\n\\nThe Bleiberg area includes the villages of Bad Bleiberg on the eastern edge of the property and Bleiberg Notch and Bleiberg Kreuth within the property itself. The larger regional centre of Villach lies 10 kilometres to the east and the city of Salzburg lies approximately 130 kilometres to the northwest. The centre of the claims are served by paved road connecting the various towns and villages, while some of the outer edges of the claim block are difficult to access.\\n\\nTemperatures range from an average high of 11\u2103 in July and August to an average low of - 8\u2103 in January and February. Annual precipitation is 1180 millimetres with a low of 70 millimetres in February and a high of 130 millimetres in June. Precipitation through the winter is larger snow. Surface surveys would be restricted to the summer months, while underground exploration would be available year round.\\n\\nSurface rights are not included with the exploration licenses. They are obtained from the individual land owners. Power is readily available as all villages are served by electricity. Water is readily available throughout the area. Mining personnel are available from the local villages and larger towns as the area has a rich mining history.\\n\\nSince the operation was in production in the past, tailings storage areas and waste disposal areas currently exist within the claims. Heap leach pads are not required. The mill buildings and mine buildings remain from the shutdown of operations though their present suitability and operational status remain to be ascertained.\\n\\n\\n## HISTORY\\n\\nThe Bleiberg property was acquired as part of an 1867 consolidation of six large and eighty small mines by Bleiberger Bergwerksunion. This company was subsequently nationalized in 1946 and operated until 1993 when it finally closed due to a combination of low metal prices and the bankruptcy of the state owned conglomerate that included Bleiberger Bergwerksunion.\\n\\nThe Austrian government held the ground underlying the Bleiberg property from 1993 until granting the current concessions to Samarium Borealis Corporation May 7, 2014. To the best of the author\\'s knowledge and the best of the Samarium\\'s knowledge there has been no exploration or mining undertaken in this intervening period between 1993 and 2014.\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bleiberg Project\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"February 2017\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Mammoth Geological Ltd.\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"-13-\" -->\\n\\nThe deposit has been developed by various adits and by five shaft systems, Antoni, Max, Stefanie, \"West-Shaft\" and Rudolf, to a depth of 900 m below surface. The lateral and vertical extent of the mineralization is best demonstrated by the glass model at the mine office. The underground workings are linked by the 8,2 km long Leopold Erbstollen and by the 12,6 km long Franz Josef-Stollen. The total length of underground tunnels, levels and crosscuts exceeds 1000 km. (Holzer and Stumpl, 1980).\\n\\nThe Bleiberg mine was in production from the 1333 until its shutdown in 1993. Production up to 1951 was concentrated on the metal-rich stratabound mineralization of the uppermost Wetterstein Formation. Approximately 3 million tons of zinc and lead metal were produced at an average grade of 1% Pb and 5% Zn. Mineralization consisted of sphalerite, galena and pyrite in oval-shaped ore bodies subparallel to the bedding and also within discordant fissures and veins. These ore bodies reached maximum sizes of 60 to 80 m2. (Zeeh and Bechstadt, 1994).\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\n![](figures/2)\\n\\n<!-- FigureContent=\"17.500 mE 20.000 ME 22.500 mE 25.000 ME 27.500 ml 10.000 ME 32.500 ME MIN 5.167.300 m H 5.107 5pomN :unselected: Kalkscholle \"Bleiberg Josefischolle Kreuth Riedhardscholle Franz Josef 5.1085.000 m N 5.165.000 m N Target zones Historic mined areas :selected: - Franz Josef Stollen / Leopold Erbstollen :unselected: - Tasca Boundary 5.162.200 ml - Modre Boundary 5.162 500 ml GKB Boundary 0 2 4 kilometres 17,500 ME 20,000 ME 22,500 mE 25,000 ME 27,500 mE 30,000 ME 32,500 mE Projection is Gauss-Kruger M31 Figure 3.

Within this body, the zinc rich mineralization occurs as networks and within breccias, and in some areas as coarse masses of sphalerite. The average grade was 0.5% Pb and 4.5% Zn. Two additional mineralized bodies, JosefischoIle and Riedhartscholle were subsequently discovered. The average grade of the 3 bodies is 6% combined Pb and Zn with Zn/Pb ratios of 6:1 to 10:1, suggesting the three bodies contained a combined 8 million tonnes. The amount of material mined and remained was not disclosed.

A Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to classify this as a current mineral resource and therefore Tasca Resources is not treating this historic estimate as a current mineral resource. Tasca has not yet been able to review the assay plans and sections, drill logs and production data to document the historic tonnages and grade and therefore cannot comment on the assumptions, parameters and methods used to prepare the historic estimate. Without this information Tasca cannot determine what resource category this historic estimate is equivalent to. In addition, Tasca has not yet been able to review the production data to determine how much of the 8 million tonnes has been mined and how much remains.\\n\\nThe exploration data for the three target zones: Kalkscholle, Josefischolle and Riedhardscholle is located within the voluminous historic records from the mining operation stored either in Vienna and at the Bleiberg site. The first step of the recommended exploration program will be to review and compile this data. The limited information provided earlier in this section and in the mineralization section on these three zones is taken from the numerous publications written on the Bleiberg deposit by Cerny, the mine geologist during the latter years of production, or by other authors who reviewed various parts of the data set.\\n\\nThe approximate location of the historic workings and three target zones are shown in Figure 3. The Franz Josef Stollen is the main access tunnel through the entire mine, while the Leopold Erbstollen appears to provide a second access and also access into the area of the Kalkscholle.\\n\\nThree various historic zones locations are taken from an undated plan and long section. While the Franz Josef is a more or less continuous zone 450 metres along strike and 215 metres down dip, the Bleiberg and Kreuth zones are more a series of individual smaller deposit scattered through the 4 kilometre strike length and 1.25 kilometre strike length respectively. The Bleiberg zone shows multiple zones spread through 400 metres of stratigraphy and show mineralization over a total depth of 850 metres. Note only the extreme western end of the Bleiberg zone lies within the current Tasca property boundary. The Kreuth zone also show multiple zones spread through 700 metres of stratigraphy over a total depth of 750 metres. More detailed maps were not made available to the author. This same plan and long section appears to indicate some mining took place in the Josefischolle and the Riedhardscholle to the west of the Max Schact.\\n\\nTable 2.

He describes the three paleostructures: Josefischolle, Riedhartscholle and Kalkscholle forming the historic estimate, documented earlier in this section.He also describes massive stratabound zones of from 1 to 5 metres thick, situated to the west of the Cardita mineralization. He provides a figure of 2 million tons but provides no other information.\\n\\n(Cerny, 1989b) indicated approximately 3 million tonnes of metal had been identified within the mine area during the last 700 years, but did not state how much had been mined or how much remains. He felt a total of 5 million tonnes is geologically possible.\\n\\n(Cerny, 1991) stated the mining industry of Bleiberg Kreuth has a potential of more than 50 million tonnes of Pb and Zn mineralization. He felt the total potential of 1200 kilometre belt of Triassic rocks was 3 million tonnes of Pb and Zn metal. His grades ranged from 3% Pb and Zn to 40% Zn (+Pb), but averaged 1% Pb and 6% Zn. He did not give an estimate on how much of this 50 million tonnes was mined nor an estimate of how much remains.\\n\\n(Zeeh and Bechstadt, 1994) concentrated on the three post 1951 mineralized bodies: Kalkscholle, Josefischolle and Riedscholle. They report these three zones contain a combined estimated 8 million tonnes at 6% combined Pb and Zn with Zn/Pb ratios of 6:1 to 10:1. The amount of this material mined subsequent to 1984 and amount remaining was not disclosed.\\n\\n(Cenry and Schroll, 1995) reported approximately 3 million tonnes of Pb and Zn metal are accounted for by the Bleiberg-Kreuth deposit with 2 million tonnes of Pb and Zn metal still present in the Bleiberg-Kreuth area. The lead and zinc grades were not provided so a potential tonnage can only be estimated based on the historic ratio of 6 to 1 to 10:1. Actual grades of the lead and zinc were not provided.\\n\\nThe previous paragraphs show a wide range of estimates with none of the estimates appearing to be clear or concise. They do definitely indicate considerable potential remains in the Bleiberg Kreuth deposits, however.\\n\\nTasca feels a geological target can be delineated based on these estimates. Cerny (1989b) estimated 3 million tonnes of lead and zinc metal was identified in the mine area as a result of the last 700 years of activity. Schroll (2006) stated total production was 2.2 million tonnes of combined lead and zinc metal. That would leave an estimate in the range of 800,000 tonnes of combined lead and zinc metal. Utilizing the Zn to Pb ratio of 6 : 1 to 10 : 1 would break the 800,000 tonnes of metal to:\\n\\n800,000 tonnes of metal at a 6:1 ratio would yield 83.33% or 666,640 tonnes of zinc and 16.67% or 133,360 tonnes of lead.\\n\\n800,000 tonnes of metal at a 10:1 ratio would yield 90% or 720,000 tonnes of zinc and 10% or 80,000 tonnes of lead.\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bleiberg Project\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"February 2017\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Mammoth Geological Ltd.\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"-17-\" -->\\n\\nCerny (1991) estimated average grades of 1% Pb and 6% Zn.\\n\\nOne metric tonne at 6% zinc yields 120 pounds of zinc, so 12, 247,399 metric tonnes at 6% zinc would be required to produce 666,640 tonnes of zinc metal.\\n\\nOne metric tonne at 6% zinc yields 120 pounds of zinc, so 13,227,720 metric tonnes at 6% zinc would be required to produce 720,000 tonnes of zinc metal.\\n\\nBased on the estimates and data provided by Cerny (1989b), Cerny (1991) and Schroll (2006) Bleiberg Kreuth has a geological target in the range of 12.25 million tonnes to 13.23 million tonnes at a grade in the order of 1% lead and 6%to 10% zinc.\\n\\nTasca Resources Ltd. cautions investors the potential quantity and grade of the geological target is conceptual in nature, there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and Tasca is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource.\\n\\n\\n## GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION\\n\\nThe Bleiberg area lies in southern Austria within the eastern Alps region of Europe. The following generalized summary is taken from Schuster et al (2013).\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\n![](figures/4)\\n\\n<!-- FigureContent=\"MIN Austria Periadriatic Bleiberg Salafossa Lineament Raibl \\\\* Mezica :selected: Italy Slovenia 0 37.5 75 kilometres\" -->\\n\\n<figcaption>\\n\\nProjection is Lat/Long WGS 84 Figure 5. Periadriatic Lineament Deposits\\n\\n</figcaption>\\n\\n</figure>\\n\\n\\nThe Alps themselves formed during the convergence of the African and European plates commencing in the Cretaceous and continuing more or less through to today. This makes the geology of the entire Alpine -Mediterranean area extremely complex due to the existence of more than one oceanic realm and several plates between Africa and Europe. The European continent consists of a deeply eroded Late Devonian to Carboniferous metamorphic continental crust, rich in plutonic rocks and covered by Carboniferous to Eocene sedimentary sequences.\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bleiberg Project\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"February 2017\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Mammoth Geological Ltd.\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"-18-\" -->\\n\\nThe area of southern Austria hosting the Bleiberg area was described in detail in Schuster et al (2013) article. From SSW to NNE, respectively from bottom to the top the following units are present:\\n\\n. The rocks at the southern border of Austria are the Southalpine unit limestones and pelites forming part of Adriatic microcontinent along with the Austroalpine Crystalline units consisting of quartzphyllites, marbles and paragneisses. The older Austroalpine units are separated from the younger Southalpine units by the Periadriatic lineament.\\n\\n. Also forming part of the Adriatic microcontinent and overlying the Austroalpine and Southalpine units are the Carboniferous to Permian carbonates and Permian to Triassic siliclastic sediments along with the middle Triassic to Jurassic carbonates. The middle Triassic to Jurassic carbonates are the host of the Beliberg deposits.\\n\\n. The Millstatt Complex is bordered to the southwest by the M\u00f6lltal fault. The dominant lithologies are the north dipping monotonous metapelites and metapsammites of the Southalpine units. Locally, calcsilicate rocks and massive marbles with intercalation of amphibolite lenses occur in this southern part, the Austroalpine Crystalline units. Permian pegmatites are common in the Millstatt Complex as well.\\n\\nThe Periadriatic lineament is an important structural feature that also appears to have localized several key lead zinc deposits along a 170 kilometre section stretching from Italy in the west through Austria and Slovenia to Romania in the east. These include: the Italian Salafossa and Raibl deposits in the west, the Austrian Bleiberg deposit in the central area and the Slovenian Mezica deposit in the east. According to Ebner et al (2000) these four deposits have accounted for more than 10 million tons of Pb Zn metal. All deposits are associated with mid- Triassic carbonates (Holzer and Stumpfl, 1980). In addition to these four deposits, more than 200 similar Pb-Zn occurrences are known in the Eastern Alps (Ebner et al, 2000).\\n\\nThese deposits are hosted in Triassic lagoonal carbonate sediments. In the Bleiberg area, these sediments exceed 300 metres in thickness and overlie the Permian Gr\u00f6den sandstone (Holzer and Stumpfl, 1980). The Gr\u00f6den sandstones are estimated at 100 metres in thickness, vary in colour from red, yellow and purple to greenish-brownish, range from clay poor to clay rich and are fine through coarse grained greywackes. (Sudar et al, 2016).\\n\\nThe descriptions of the remaining units are summarized from Zeeh and Bechstadt (1994). Overlying the Gr\u00f6den sandstone are 50 metres of gypsum-bearing red and green marly and sandy sedimentary rocks of the Werfen Formation. Two hundred metres of Alpine Muschelkalk marly limestones, deposited in a shallow water marine environment, overlie the Werfen rocks.\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bleiberg Project\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"February 2017\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Mammoth Geological Ltd.\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"-19-\" -->\\n\\nThe key unit is the Wetterstein Formation, a dolomitic carbonate platform exhibiting different lithologies. Based on a south to north transect through the formation in the Bleiberg- Kreuth area the dolomites show the following environments: a basal reef facies characterized by corals, sponges and microproblematicum; a back reef facies consisting of fine reef debris; a near reef lagoonal to tidal flat facies exhibiting alternations of sub-tidal and inter-tidal to supra-tidal sediments; a far reef lagoonal facies dominated by sub-tidal carbonates and alagaes; the main Bleiberg facies, consisting of cyclic sequences of alternating sub-tidal and inter-tidal to supratidal carbonates; and a central lagoonal to tidal flat facies. The inter-fingered sub-tidal and inter-tidal to supra-tidal carbonates are interpreted as the product of a restricted sedimentary environment, located behind areas of small topographic relief. The entire formation ranges from 970 to 1120 metres in thickness.\\n\\nThe Bleiberg facies, host to the bulk of the Pb-Zn mineralization, consists of cyclic sequences of alternating subtidal and intertidal to supratidal carbonates. Emersion layers are frequently found intercalated and are characterized by microkarst as weIl as calcretes, greenish marls and lithoclastic-wackestones / floatstones with black pebbles. Syn-sedimentary or early diagenetic evaporites, including grey anhydrite and barite, are sometimes finely dispersed within the carbonate rocks. The Bleiberg facies is interpreted to represent a cyclically exposed paleo- topographic high, paralleling the platform margin for several kilometres. The Kalkscholle, Riedhartscholle and Josefischolle paleo-topographic highs occur in the vicinity. These possible horst blocks consist of sub-tidal to inter-tidal carbonates, and were mostly sub-aerially exposed, were deeply karstified, and were affected by massive dolomitization. The four topographic highs form the major lead-zinc bearing rock types of the upper Wetterstein Formation.\\n\\nThe Raibl Formation overlies the Wetterstein Formation and consists of three 10 to 40 metre thick terrigenous clastic and 30 to 70 metre thick carbonate evaporate units. These are interpreted as alternating carbonate and clastic third-order cycles caused by sea-level fluctuations. Mineralization is confined to the carbonate units, especially the lowermost carbonate interval with occasionally rich stratabound ores in the western part of the Bleiberg deposit.\\n\\nThe 1000 metre thick Hauptdolomit overlies the Raibl Group with the contact marked by a breccia horizon at the base of the Hauptdolomit.\\n\\nThe Bleiberg property is underlain predominantly by the Wetterstein Formation carbonates with the exception of the southeast corner, which is underlain by the Gr\u00f6den sandstone. Mineralization is associated with more or less, east-west trending faults that appear to be splays related to the Periadriatic lineament.\\n\\n\\n### Mineralization\\n\\nMore than 3 million tonnes of Pb and Zn metal were recovered from the Bleiberg deposits from initial mining in 1333 until closure in 1993. The mine geologist during the final years of production estimated roughly 2 million tonnes of metal remains (Cerny and Schroll, 1995). Metal content varied from 1% Zn to more than 30% Zn in massive sphalerite bodies. Production during the final years of production concentrated on zones containing more than 7% Zn. (Zeeh and Bechstadt, 1994).\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bleiberg Project\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"February 2017 Mammoth Geological Ltd.\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"-20-\" -->\\n\\nThe lead zinc mineralization is concentrated in several different units of the Wetterstein formation as detailed in Zeeh and Bechstadt (1994):\\n\\nThe Maxer B\u00e4nke, a thick cyclic sequence of shallow marine carbonates, marly limestones and greyish carbonates with a clay content of up to 10%, the green marls, occurs about 180 to 370 metres below the first Raibl shale. The green marls are interpreted represent the product of terrigenous weathering. Concordant and discordant orebodies consisting mainly of sphalerite, galena and pyrite or marcasite occur within the Maxer B\u00e4nke, The average metal content of this sequence is about 0.4% Pb and 2.8% Zn yielding approximately 60,000 tonnes of Pb and Zn.\\n\\nMining at Bleiberg-Kreuth was restricted for more than six centuries to the metal-rich stratabound mineralization of the Bleiberg Facies. Nine of the emersion layers within the 60 metre thick Bleiberg Facies form lithostratigraphic markers used to facilitate exploration and mapping of Alpine structures. Mineralization occurs within oval-shaped bodies found subparallel to the bedding and within discordant fissures and veins. Sphalerite, galena and pyrite are the main ore components. Fluorite and blue-coloured anhydrite are the main accessory minerals in the western part of the mine, while barite prevails in the eastern part. The average metal content of this sequence is about 1% Pb and 5% Zn and approximately 3 million tonnes of Zn and Pb metal have been produced since mining started, largely from orebodies 60 to 80 square metres in size.\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\n![](figures/5)\\n\\n<!-- FigureContent=\"100 mE 194,000 ME 395,000 mE 400.0CO Dientennde 7.2 Lipo 5.1033.000 m M Stade!

The first, the Kalkscholle, was a stock-shaped orebody of about 2 million cubic metres hosted by dolomitic rocks. The zinc mineralization occurs as breccia networks and locally as coarse masses of sphalerite. The average metal content was 0.5% Pb and 4.5% Zn. Subsequent sedimentological and geochemical investigations located the Josefischolle and Riedhartscholle. These three orebodies contained 8 million tonnes at an average combined Pb Zn grade of 6%. The Zn/Pb ratios range from 6: 1 to 10: 1. These orebodies lead to the introduction of more highly mechanized mining methods resulting in increases in production to 500,000 tonnes per year during the later years of mining.\\n\\nTasca cautions investors it is not relying on this 8 million tonne historic estimate. A Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to classify this as a current mineral resource and therefore Tasca Resources is not treating this historic estimate as a current mineral resource. Tasca has not yet been able to review the assay plans and sections, drill logs and production data to document the historic tonnages and grade and therefore cannot comment on the assumptions, parameters and methods used to prepare the historic estimate. Without this information Tasca cannot determine what resource category this historic estimate is equivalent to. In addition, Tasca has not yet been able to review the production data to determine how much of the 8 million tonnes has been mined and how much remains.\\n\\nThe increased intensity of underground exploration also located additional mineralization, breccias containing mineralization-bearing clasts, south of the Riedhartscholle. The clasts were derived from the Riedhartscholle and the overlying Raibl Formation.\\n\\nLead zinc mineralization also occurs in the first Raibl dolomite, the Cardita, located to the west of the mining area. Cardita consists of subparallel massive mineralization 1 to 5 metres in thickness. The metal content is about 10% Zn and Pb with a Zn/Pb ratio of 1: 6.\\n\\nIn addition to the lead and zinc, germanium was an important by-product through its production history. Based on statistics kept since 1951, the average grades of these by-products are: 200 ppm germanium, 1800 ppm cadmium, 60 ppm thallium and 10 ppm gallium, largely found within the zinc concentrates. (Cerny, 1991). Within the Bleiberg mine the Ge contents of some sphalerite types vary. Sphalerites from the Bleiberg facies contain much more Ge (up to 600ppm) than sphalerites from the Kalk-, Riedhart- and Josefischolle (max. 100ppm). In contrast, ore-bearing clasts derived from the Riedhartscholle contain higher Ge contents. (Zeeh and Bechstadt, 1994)\\n\\nOf a total inferred metal content of 5 million tonnes, the Bleiberg Pb-Zn deposit has produced about 3 million tonnes of metal according to Cerny (1989a). The deposit itself extends 12km in strike and 800m have been explored in depth by underground mine workings. However, the extent of the whole deposit and its definite limits and borders to the host rock have not yet been explored in detail. (Schroll et al, 1994).\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bleiberg Project\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"February 2017 Mammoth Geological Ltd.\" -->\\n\\n-22- DEPOSIT TYPES\\n\\nThe Bleiberg property is being explored for Mississippi Valley Type Lead Zinc Deposits. The following mineral deposit model is summarized from Leach and Taylor (2009).\\n\\nThe following are the key characteristics of Mississippi Valley Type deposits:\\n\\n\u00b7 they are epigenetic;\\n\\n\u00b7 they are not associated with igneous activity;\\n\\n. they are hosted mainly by dolostone and limestone, rarely in sandstone;\\n\\n\u00b7 the dominant minerals are sphalerite, galena, pyrite, marcasite, dolomite, and calcite, whereas barite is typically minor to absent, and fluorite is rare;\\n\\n. they occur in platform carbonate sequences, commonly at the flanks of basins or in foreland thrust belts;\\n\\n. they are commonly stratabound, but may be locally stratiform;\\n\\n. they typically occur in large districts;\\n\\n. the ore fluids were basinal brines with around 10 to 30 weight percent salts;\\n\\n\u00b7 they have crustal sources for metals and sulfur;\\n\\n\u00b7 temperatures of ore deposition are typically 75\u2103 to about 200\u2103;\\n\\n. the most important ore controls are faults and fractures, dissolution collapse breccias, and lithological transitions;\\n\\n\u00b7 sulfides are coarsely crystalline to fine-grained, massive to disseminated;\\n\\n\u00b7 the sulfides occur mainly as replacement of carbonate rocks and, to a lesser extent, open- space fill;\\n\\n\u00b7 alteration consists mainly of dolomitization, host-rock dissolution, and brecciation.\\n\\nMississippi Valley-type (MVT) lead-zinc deposits are found throughout the world, characteristically distributed over hundreds of square kilometers that define individual districts. Large MVT districts include: Pine Point (1,600 km2), Tri-State (1,800 km2), Upper Silesia (2,800 km2), Southeast Missouri (3,000 km2), Upper Mississippi Valley (7,800 km2), Irish Midlands (8,000 km2), and the Alpine (10,000 km2). Pine Point contains more than 80 individual deposits and the Upper Mississippi Valley contains nearly individual 400 deposits, for example. Individual deposits vary greatly in size within a district: most deposits in the Pine Point district are between 0.2 and 2 million tonnes with the largest at 18 million tonnes; while the average deposit size in the Upper Mississippi Valley district is between 0.1 and 0.5 million tonnes with only a few larger than 3 million tonnes. The median size of MVT deposits is 7.0 million tonnes. Some MVT hydrothermal events formed numerous districts in a large area that define huge metallogenic provinces. While individual districts can be quite distinct, deposits within individual districts typically have similar deposit attributes and ore controls.\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bleiberg Project\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"February 2017\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Mammoth Geological Ltd.\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"-23-\" -->\\n\\nMost MVT deposits are hosted in Phanerozoic rocks and are significantly less common in Proterozoic rocks. Only one known deposit occurs in Late Archean rocks. MVT deposits are located in platform carbonate sequences in passive margin environments and are commonly related to extensional domains landward of Phanerozoic contractional tectonic belts. Many MVT deposits formed during the Devonian to Permian time, related to a series of intense tectonic events during the assimilation of Pangea. This period accounts for approximately 61 percent of the Pb and Zn in dated MVT deposits. The second most important period for MVT deposit genesis was Cretaceous to Tertiary time, when microplate assimilation affected the western margin of North America and Africa-Eurasia. This lead to deposition of approximately 36 percent of the Pb and Zn in dated deposits.\\n\\nThe median size of MVT deposits is 7.0 million tonnes with grades of 1.9 percent Pb, 6.0 percent Zn, 0.23 percent Cu, and 32.5 g/t Ag. Zinc and lead are the primary commodities with generally a 10:1 mass ratio of Zn to Pb metal. Some deposits and districts yield only zinc, while other predominantly only lead. By product commodities include: silver, copper, and indium with lesser recoverable economic levels of germanium, gallium, and cadmium and sub- economic levels of cobalt.\\n\\nThe largest known MVT deposits are: Mehdiabad, Iran (394 million tonnes containing 22.9 million tonnes Pb+Zn), Pavlovskoye, Russia (128 million tonnes containing 7.0 million tonnes Pb+Zn) and Admiral Bay, Australia (120 million tonnes containing 10.4 million tonnes Pb+Zn). The highest grade deposits include: Schmalgraf, Belgium (26.1 percent Pb+Zn; 24 percent Zn) and Touissit-Bou Beker, Morocco (13 percent Pb).\\n\\n\\n## EXPLORATION\\n\\nTasca Resources Ltd. has yet to undertake any exploration on the Bleiberg property, so this section is not yet relevant.\\n\\n\\n## DRILLING\\n\\nTasca Resources Ltd. has yet to undertake any exploration on the Bleiberg property, so it has not undertaken any drilling.\\n\\nHowever, drilling was a key part of annual mine exploration while the Bleiberg Mine was in production with 35,000 metres of drilling completed on an annual basis during the later years of mine life (Cerny, 1989a). Review of this drilling will be a key aspect of the compilation phase of the recommended exploration program.\\n\\n\\n## SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY\\n\\nTasca Resources Ltd. has yet to undertake any exploration on the Bleiberg property, so this section is not yet relevant.\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bleiberg Project\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"February 2017 Mammoth Geological Ltd.\" -->\\n\\n-24- DATA VERIFICATION\\n===\\n\\nData verification has proven to be somewhat of an issue with this project. Hard geological data: assay plans, drill logs, property geological maps, etc. are not readily available as they are archived in various government locations within Austria. However, there are abundant geological reports describing the property, mine, project and exploration potential both in English and in German. The author was able to obtain and review a number of these documents, utilizing Google Translate to crudely translate the German reports into English. While some finer detail is lost, the general sense of individual reports can easily be understood.\\n\\nTherefore the maps provided with this technical report are more general in nature. The locations of the workings and the exploration targets can only be located approximately with an estimated accuracy of 50 to 100 metres. This is more than sufficient at this time as there is no issue with boundaries and the targets lie well within the current property boundaries.\\n\\nThe author visited the area toured a small portion of the mine workings. The author has been informed by Samarium personnel the Franz Josef Stollen is open and available to access the area of the exploration targets. This will be key for access to allow for economical exploration of the target areas.\\n\\nThe author therefore, feels the data reviewed and examined is adequate for the purposes of this technical report.\\n\\n\\n## MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING\\n\\nTasca Resources Ltd. has not undertaken any mineral processing or metallurgical testing on the Bleiberg property, so this section is not yet relevant. However, a brief summary of the milling process during historic operations was given by Schroll (1971).\\n\\nThe run-of-mine grades were 1.7% to 4.5% Pb and 4.0% to 8.0% Zn. In addition, some of the older stockpiles (assumed to be waste dumps) with grades of 2.4% to 4.0% Zn were also run. After comminution, the resulting slurry was first processed in a 100 tonne per hour flotation circuit where 40% of the slurry was discarded as float tailings. The remaining 60% concentrate slurry was sent to for further flotation at a rate of 40 tonnes per hour.\\n\\nSchroll (1971) listed the 1971 production figures as 261,000 tonnes of run-of-mine and 109,000 tonnes of stockpiled material at an average grade of 2.1% Pb and 5.8% Zn. Approximately 8,400 tonnes of lead concentrates at 75% Pb and approximately 31,900 tonnes of zinc concentrates at 57% Zn were produced.\\n\\nHolzer and Stumpl (1980) listed production figures for 1978 as 476,340 tonnes of run-of-mine at average grades of 1.2% Pb and 5.7% Zn. Approximately 5,971 tonnes of lead concentrates and approximately 39,471 tonnes of zinc concentrates were produced.\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bleiberg Project\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"February 2017\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Mammoth Geological Ltd.\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"-25- MINERAL RESOURCES AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES\" -->\\n\\nThere are no mineral reserves or mineral resources associated with the Bleiberg project at this time.\\n\\n\\n## ADJACENT PROPERTIES\\n\\nThis report is not relying on technical information from any adjacent properties as there are no relevant adjacent properties.\\n\\n\\n## OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION\\n\\nThe author is not aware of any additional relevant data or information with respect to the technical report.\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\n<figcaption>\\n\\nPlate 1.

The extended exploration and production history spanning more than 700 years was successful in locating several areas of significant mineralization over well in excess of 15 kilometres.\\n\\nThere are three main types of mineralization in the Bleiberg project area: the classic stratabound \"Bleiberg\" mineralization in the uppermost 60 metres of the Wetterstein Formation; the Kalkscholle, Josefischolle, Riedhardscholle breccia bodies in the western section of the mine and the stratabound mineralization in the overlying Raibl or Cardita formation, again in the western section of the mine. (Zeeh and Bechstadt, 1994).\\n\\nHistorically, development and production centred on the Bleiberg style mineralization through to the 1950\\'s. These were smaller, but richer, zones of stratabound massive sulfides formed oval shaped bodies up to 60 to 80 square metres in size, within 9 distinct layers in the top 60 metres of the Wetterstein Formation (Zeeh and Bechstadt, 1994). These ore bodies appears in the West Central, East Central and East Sections of the glass model at the mine site (Plate 1).\\n\\nThe references reviewed by the author seem to suggest further exploration for these zones has all but ceased, as post 1950 exploration was concentrated on the \"scholle\" zones and the Cardita zone. The Samarium representatives have suggested hanging wall mineralization may exist through this section of the deposit; a thorough review of the exploration data will indicate if this is the case or not.\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\n![](figures/7)\\n\\n<!-- FigureContent=\"N S Haupdolomit Haupdolomite breccia. 4 Raibl Dolomite 3 Raibl Shale 3 Raibl Dolomite 2 Raibl Shale 2 Cardita zone 350 metres Raibl Dolomite 1 Raibl Shale 1 \"scholle zone\" Wetterstein Limestone - Dolomite \\\\`mineralized [breccia ore bodies in red Maxer B\u00e4nke\" -->\\n\\n</figure>\\n\\n\\n|||\\n| - | - |\\n| Sedimentalogical parameters | Bleiberg facies cyclic and partly evaporitic lagoonal environment |\\n| Mineralization characteristics | stratabound Pb-Zn Pb : Zn = 1:1 high Ge content is spaherlite |\\n\\nKalkscholle, Josefischolle, Riedhartscholle\\n\\nLagoonal environment\\n\\ndisseminated and massive sphalerite Pb : Zn = 1:10 low Ge content is spaherlite\\n\\nbreccias with mineralized clasts Pb : Zn = ? high Ge content is spaherlite\\n\\nTaken from Zeeh and Bechstadt (1994)\\n\\nFigure 7.

The first discovery, the Kalkscholle, is a dolomite hosted, 2 million cubic metre stock shaped orebody with mineralization occurring as networks and breccias and local areas of masses of sphalerite. Further exploration located the Riedhartscholle and the Josefischolle, similar stock shaped orebodies. (Zeeh and Bechstadt, 1994). The glass model (West Section) appears to show mining of the parts of the Riedhartscholle and Josefischolle, though the author will need to make final confirmation of the location of the \"scholle\" zones during the thorough review of the data in Austria.\\n\\nThere is further potential in the suspected unmined portions of the Riedhartscholle and Josefischolle as well as the suspected unmined Kalkscholle. A review of the data should also indicate if there is exploration potential for additional zones along strike.\\n\\nIn addition, Zeeh and Bechstadt (1994) indicate a new style of mineralization was discovered during the exploration of Riedhartscholle. A breccia with individual mineralized clasts within the Wetterstein Formation was discovered south of the Riedhartscholle as shown in the schematic (Figure 7). The clasts were derived from the Riedhartscholle and the overlying Raibl Formation. There is little additional information on this zone in the later literature, and this needs to be followed up during the thorough review of the mine documents in Austria.\\n\\nThe Cardita zone lies within the Raibl Dolomite 1, the lowermost dolomite of the Raibl Group, situated above the paleotopographic highs of the Riedhart-, Josefi- and Kalk- scholle. The zone consists of massive stratabound mineralization, 1 to 5 m thick, found subparallel to the bedding. (Zeeh and Bechstadt, 1994). They can be several hundred metres in diameter (Holzer and Stumpl, 1980). The metal content is about 10% Zn and Pb with a Zn/Pb ratio of 1: 6. (Zeeh and Bechstadt, 1994).\\n\\nThe later references continue to emphasize the exploration potential of the \"scholle\" zones, the Cardita zones and the mineralized clast breccias. The issue seems to be how much of this potential was actually tested and how much of the known mineralization in these zones was actually mined. Cerny (1989a) states annual underground exploration consists of 3 kilometres of drifting and 35,000 metres of drilling. The time frame this level of exploration carried on was not included. However, the amount of material identified versus the amount of material mined suggests there is still a considerable volume of mineralized material unmined.\\n\\nAside from the need to confirm the volume of mineralized material unmined, the author is not aware of any other significant risks or uncertainties that could reasonably be expected to affect the reliability or confidence of the exploration information.\\n\\nThe Bleiberg property is therefore a project of merit and further exploration is warranted. The initial step will be a review and compilation of the voluminous historical data. This will need to be accomplished in Austria as the data is stored in country at various government agencies throughout the country. The objective of the program will be to confirm the volume of unmined mineralized material remaining and to define targets for initial exploration, expected to consist of underground drilling.\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bleiberg Project\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"February 2017 Mammoth Geological Ltd.\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"-28-\" -->\\n\\nA follow up underground drilling program in the order of 5,000 feet will be required. There may also be significant costs associated with rehabbing the existing workings to allow safe access for the drillers to the drill sites.\\n\\n\\n## RECOMMENDATIONS\\n\\nA two phase exploration program is recommended for the Bleiberg project. The first phase is a first pass review of the voluminous exploration data at the various government agencies in Austria. This will require two experienced Canadian geologists with some mining production experience to undertake the review. An experienced Austrian geologist somewhat fluent in English will also be required to translate both in Austrian government offices and the documents and maps in German. This is estimated to cost $200,000.\\n\\nThe second stage will consist of first pass underground drilling in the order of 1,500 metres, at an all in estimated cost of $340,000.\\n\\nTable 3. 2017 Exploration Budget\\n\\n||||||||\\n| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |\\n| Phase I - Compilation and Targets |||||||\\n| Project Manager | 45 | days | @ | $800 | / day | $36,000 |\\n| Senior Geologist | 45 | days | @ | $700 | / day | $31,500 |\\n| Austrian Geologist | 45 | days | @ | $600 | / day | $27,000 |\\n| Room & Board | 135 | days | @ | $200 | / day | $27,000 |\\n| Vehicles and fuel | 90 | days | @ | $100 | / day | $9,000 |\\n| Travel | | | | | | $15,000 |\\n| Permitting | | | | | | $20,000 |\\n| Contingency | | | | | | $27,000 |\\n| Report | | | | | | $7,500 |\\n| Total Budget | | | | | | $200,000 |\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bleiberg Project\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"February 2017\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Mammoth Geological Ltd.\" -->\\n\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"-29\" -->\\n\\nTable 3. 2017 Exploration Budget (Continued)\\n\\n| Phase II - Drilling |||||||\\n| Project Manager | 15 | days | @ | $800 | / day | $12,000 |\\n| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |\\n| Senior Geologist | 0 | days | @ | $700 | / day | $0 |\\n| Austrian Geologist | 30 | days | @ | $600 | / day | $18,000 |\\n| Room & Board | 45 | days | @ | $200 | / day | $9,000 |\\n| Vehicles and fuel | 45 | days | @ | $100 | / day | $4,500 |\\n| Drill mob/ demob | | | | | | $5,000 |\\n| Metreage (all in) | 1500 | metres | @ | $110 | / metre | $165,000 |\\n| Analysis - core | 1500 | sample | @ | $40 | / sample | $60,000 |\\n| Analysis - standards | 35 | sample | @ | $24 | / sample | $840 |\\n| Travel | | | | | | $5,000 |\\n| Sundries | | | | | | $10,000 |\\n| Contingency | | | | | | $43,160 |\\n| Report | | | | | | $7,500 |\\n| Total Budget | | | | | | $340,000 |\\n\\n\\n## REFERENCES\\n\\nCerny, I (1989a).

SUMMARY\\n===  \\nOn 26 May 2017, Forrester Metals Inc. (\"Forrester\") of Toronto, Ontario Canada accepted the proposal of Watts, Griffis and McOuat Limited (\"WGM\") to prepare a technical report that is compliant with Canada\\'s security rule National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") for the Bongar\u00e1 zinc-oxide project (the \"Project\"). On June 1, 2017, Zinc One Resources Inc. (\"Zinc One\") of Vancouver, Canada acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Forrester Metals Inc. As a result, this report has been prepared for Zinc One.  \\nThe area of interest is located in the Yambrasbamba District of Bongara Province within the Amazonas Department in north-central Peru. The Project is located approximately 695 km north-northwest of Lima and 190 west-northwest of the nearest airport at Tarapoto (Figure 1). The Project includes eight mineral concessions for 8,009.5 hectares (\"ha\") that comprise the Bongar\u00e1 Zinc Mine Project (\"BZMP\") and five mineral concessions for 3,115.4 ha that comprise the Charlotte-Bongar\u00e1 Zone Project (\"CBZP\").  \\nThe Project is hosted within a substantial zinc belt that extends the entire length of Peru and hosts a great many carbonate replacement deposits of various genetic affinities.  \\nThe BZMP mineralization was discovered by Canadian geologist William Menges in 1973. A number of companies have explored the area since that time including Noranda Explorations Co. (1974-1984), Canper Resources (1986), Solitario Resources (\"Solitario\") (1993-95), Cominco Ltd. (1997)), Mauricio Hochschild & C\u00eda. (\"MHC\") (2003-2005), and C\u00eda. Minera Corianta SA (\"Corianta\") (2005-2011). Zinc One commenced its exploration program in September, 2017, which started with sampling of existing exploration pits followed by drilling in 2018.  \\nWGM first visited the Property in the mid- and late 1980s for Cominco. During 1987, WGM made a historical \"preliminary resource estimate\" that was based on 20 test pits and resulted in a historical resource of 325,000 tonnes averaging 27.8% Zn and 1.8% Pb. While this estimate was made by appropriately qualified professionals, it was completed prior to the implementation of current Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\"CIM\") standards for classifying Mineral Resource estimates as required under NI 43-101 and should therefore not be relied upon for investment decisions.  \\nMany pits have been excavated, most notably 497 hand-dug pits on a nominal 25 metre grid by Solitario during 1993-95. A subsequent Solitario historical mineral resources estimate in 1995 was based on the test-pits and was predicated on the use of a 7.5% Zn+Pb cut-off grade  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"\\\\- 1 -\" -->\\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/8)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"820,000m.E 830,000m.E 840,000m.E AMAZONAS / DEPARTMENT 1 PROPERTY OUTLINE Charlita Cotrina\\'s House, Yolanda Hacienda Chavez North EL Juanita Aguila -Edison\\'s House Utcubamba Province Bagua\\'s Esperanza House Rio Cristal Charita Camp Marita Cuba\\'s House Bongara Province 9,370,000m.N Cajaruro District Charlita Cristal Camp Anita Willians Lupita Erika \\\\\\\\ 9,370,000m.N House Alindor\\'s House Lazaro\\'s House - Nestor\\'s House Campo Cielo Jose\\'s House Mina Chica Nueva Ramon\\'s House :selected: Rio Imasa Miraflores :selected: Rio San Jose /Callaton\\'s House Il Callaton\\'s Mina Grande Camp 1 Esperanza N Estela\\'s House San Jose :unselected: House / Yambrasbamba Buenos Saldana\\'s House Aires 9,360,000m.N Yambrasbamba 9,360,000m.N 0 2 10 District Kilometres UTM WGS84 Zone 17S Florida Florida District nonN Legend: - 9,350,000m.N :unselected: Property outline Shipasbamba District .

There was no discussion of the impact of moisture content.  \\nThis estimate produced historical resources of approximately 1.64 Mt at 19.3% Zn and 2.3% Pb for the main zone of mineralization at Mina Grande and approximately 0.27 Mt at 19.0% Zn and 1.3% Pb in a smaller zone referred to as Mina Chica. Like the historical WGM estimate, these resources are not compliant with CIM standards and guidelines and cannot be relied upon. Following this, MHC drilled 69 diamond holes totalling 1,974.88 m during 2003-2005.  \\nThe CBZP was the focus of exploration between 2006 and 2011 by Rio Cristal Resources Corp. and its predecessor (\"Rio Cristal\"). Its mineral concessions covered a larger area than Zinc One\\'s concessions today. Within that larger area, at least 773 rock, 871 soil and 339 stream-sediment samples were collected, and in addition, 97 diamond holes totalling 9,141.7 m were drilled with a focus on the Cristal and Charlita prospects. Near-surface, high- grade, zinc-oxide mineralization was encountered throughout the area, however an NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate was never filed. Approximately 150,000 tonnes of zinc ore was mined from the Mina Grande Centro and Mina Grande North sectors of the BZMP during 2007-08 (see Figure 1). High-grade ore was shipped to the coast where it was treated using a Waelz kiln to produce zinc calcine that was sold to various smelters and approximately 25,000 tonnes of zinc metal was produced. Corianta explored the area to the northwest and completed surface sampling and trenching at Camp Cielo (see Figure 1).  \\nThe most recent historical mineral resources estimated at Bongar\u00e1 are from a 2011 report by Corianta that cited 1.01 Mt at a grade of 21.61% Zn as \"measured\" and \"indicated\" and 0.21 Mt at a grade of 21.18% Zn a \"inferred\" from five zones: 1) Mina Grand\u00e9 Sur, 2) Mina Grande Centro, 3) Mina Grande Nort\u00e9, 4) Mina Chica, and 5) Bongarita. Although the resource categories are not compliant with CIM definitions, the higher confidence areas are relevant as they represent the main targets for future exploration and development work on the Bongar\u00e1 zinc-oxide mineralization.  \\nWGM has not completed sufficient work to verify any of these historical estimates as current resource estimates, and therefore they cannot be treated as current resource estimates or relied upon for investment decisions.  \\nBetween September 2017 and January 2018, Zinc One collected 473 samples from selected historical exploration pits and from the surface in the Bongarita, Mina Chica, Mina Grande Nort\u00e9 and Mina Grande Sur areas (Table 1). Between February and July 2018, Zinc One  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"\\\\- 3 -\" -->\\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/11)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"Watts, Griffis and McOuat\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\ncompleted 264 diamond drill holes totalling 7,930.6 m using NTW-sized core in the five sectors with known mineralization.  \\nTABLE 1 SUMMARY OF EXPLORATION COMPLETED, September 2017 - January, 2018  \\n| Sector | Pit/Surface Samples | Drill Holes | Metres Drilled |\\n| - | - | - | - |\\n| Bongarita | 40 | 36 | 587.2 |\\n| Mina Chica | 146 | 53 | 2,327.9 |\\n| Mina Grand\u00e9 Nort\u00e9 | 59 | 16 | 449.8 |\\n| Mina Grande Centro | 0 | 64 | 2,237.3 |\\n| Mina Grande Sur | 228 | 95 | 2,328.4 |\\n| Totals | 473 | 264 | 7,930.6 |  \\nFollowing the surveying, test pitting and drilling programs and the receipt of the assay results from Zinc One\\'s samples, WGM modelled the geology and estimated the Mineral Resources. The BZMP Mineral Resources occur in five zones of variable mineralization that have the potential for economic extraction of zinc from oxide-type zinc mineralization. The minimum 10% zinc cut-off grade was selected in order to determine the amount of higher-grading mineral resources approaching 20% zinc. WGM\\'s sensitivity analysis included additional estimates using cut-off grades of 5% and 15% zinc. The block sizes used for the estimates were applied with the assumption that the resources have potential bulk mineable characteristics and have been appropriately estimated using these parameters. Mineral Resource estimates, with an effective date of January 30, 2019, are summarised as follows in Tables 2 and 3.  \\nThe various zones on the property were divided into domains that were constrained by grade and geology. WGM\\'s exploratory data analysis was carried out resulting in the use of 3.0 m run-length composites on the drill hole data for each of the zones.  \\nOn the basis of previous historical mining, and recent exploration work by Zinc One during 2017-18, including bulk density measurements on core samples, a bulk density of 1.90 T/m3 was assigned to mineralized material reported in the Mineral Resource estimates.  \\nThe Mineral Resource estimates are based on surface diamond drilling, including historical drilling results where the drill sites could be confirmed, as well as recent surface sampling from excavated pits up to several metres deep. There are a total of 320 drill holes with an  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"\\\\- 4 -\" -->\\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/12)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"Watts, Griffis and McOuat\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\naggregate length of 9,180 m and 723 surface samples with an aggregate length of 2,133 m used for the estimates.  \\nOn the basis of WGM\\'s exploratory data analysis and the grade distribution of zinc assay data, a 40% zinc top cut grade was applied to assay values before compositing. The difference in contained metal between the uncut and cut grades for the resource estimates ranges from about 0.5% to 7% depending on the domain.  \\nA 5x5x5m block model was used for each zone with grades interpolated into constrained domains using ordinary kriging.  \\nThe cut-off value used for the 2019 resource estimates is based on the three year average metal price US $1.20/lb for Zn. There are no current metallurgical studies for the property and WGM makes no assumptions with respect to recovery of zinc for the Mineral Resource estimates.  \\nTABLE 2 INDICATED MINERAL RESOURCES FOR THE BONGAR\u00c1 MINE PROJECT as of January, 2019  \\n| Deposit | Tonnage | Zn Grade (%) | Zn (kg) | Zn (lbs) |\\n| - | - | - | - | - |\\n| Mina Grand\u00e9 Sur | 161,000 | 18.2 | 29,300,000 | 65,000,000 |\\n| Mina Grande Centro | 172,000 | 17.1 | 29,400,000 | 65,000,000 |\\n| Mina Grand\u00e9 Nort\u00e9 | 140,000 | 21.0 | 29,400,000 | 65,000,000 |\\n| Mina Chica | 339,000 | 19.3 | 65,400,000 | 144,000,000 |\\n| Bongarita | 10,000 | 13.8 | 1.400,000 | 3,000,000 |\\n| All Zones - TOTAL | 822,000 | 18.9 | 155,000,000 | 342,000,000 |  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"\\\\- 5 -\" -->\\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/13)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"Watts, Griffis and McOuat\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\nTABLE 3 INFERRED MINERAL RESOURCES FOR THE BONGAR\u00c1 MINE PROJECT as of January, 2019  \\n| Deposit | Tonnage | Zn Grade (%) | Zn (kg) | Zn (lbs) |\\n| - | - | - | - | - |\\n| Mina Grande Sur | 436,000 | 17.4 | 75,900,000 | 167,000,000 |\\n| Mina Grand\u00e9 Centro | 201,000 | 16.0 | 32,200,000 | 71,000,000 |\\n| Mina Grande Norte | 450,000 | 16.5 | 74,300,000 | 164,000,000 |\\n| Mina Chica | 252,000 | 16.9 | 42,600,000 | 94,000,000 |\\n| Bongarita | 700 | 12.7 | 90,000 | 200,000 |\\n| All Zones - TOTAL | 1,340,000 | 16.8 | 225,000,000 | 496,000,000 |  \\nThe following notes are important to the understanding of the aforementioned report of Mineral Resources:  \\n1\\\\. Resources were estimated using composites within constrained block models with block dimensions of 5x5x5m and using ordinary kriging grade interpolation methods.  \\n2\\\\. Top cuts at a grade of 40% Zn were applied to Zn grades of assays before compositing. A cut-off grade of 10% Zn was applied which incorporates 3 year average metal prices and approximates the cut-off used during past mining operations. Zn% grades can be converted by applying a conversion factor of 22.046 pounds per Zn% to obtain lbs of Zn per metric tonne;  \\n3\\\\. A Bulk Density of 1.90 was applied using the geological block model density field.  \\n4\\\\. Mineral Resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by commodity prices, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues.  \\n5\\\\. The quantity and grade of estimated Inferred Mineral Resources is uncertain in nature as there has been insufficient exploration to define these resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource, and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in up-grading the confidence level of Inferred Resources.  \\n6\\\\. The Mineral Resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\"CIM\") Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council May 10, 2014; and mandated in National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\").  \\n7\\\\. Figures may not total due to rounding.  \\nThe mineralized trend on which the zinc-bearing zones are located represents an excellent target for additional drilling. In WGM\\'s opinion, in-fill drilling with the objective of up- grading the Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated Mineral Resources is warranted. Zinc grade variability is sufficient however, that not all Inferred Resources will be up-graded. With continuing exploration drilling in the Mina Chica area, some enlargement of the deposit is possible. Exploration drilling along the trend between Mina Chica and Campo Ceilo and  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"\\\\- 6 -\" -->\\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/14)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"Watts, Griffis and McOuat\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\nsix kilometres (6 km) farther to the Cristal zinc prospect area should be considered in future drilling programs.  \\nWith respect to maintaining the data available for Mineral Resource estimation, WGM recommends that Zinc One continue, as it did during 2018, to collect detailed rock quality data (\"RQD\") and core recovery data on a sample by sample basis.  \\nAlthough the measurement of specific gravity on selected drill core samples to achieve guidance on the bulk density of the mineralization has provided a useful basis for the Mineral Resources estimates, the understanding of bulk density data should be improved through the systematic measuring of larger-scale excavated and drill core samples of typical mineralization. This should be done to provide sufficient data density to develop a bulk density model for the deposits.  \\nWGM also recommends that survey control be improved by means of establishing additional permanent monuments in each deposit area to be used for improved location of drill hole co- ordinates. Zinc One will continue marking drill hole collars with permanent cement markers.  \\nThe existing assay database includes lead and silver analyses, however many of the lead assays and some silver assays exceed the upper detection limit for the analytical technique used. This is not the case for zinc which was re-analysed to ascertain the content for samples exceeding the detection limit. This lack of data has prevented WGM from reliably estimating the average lead and silver grades for the deposits. WGM recommends that the actual lead and silver content be determined for all those samples affected by over-limit assays to allow these metals to be included in the Mineral Resources estimates, and it further recommends that actual values be determined in the future for all over-limit lead and silver values.  \\nTable 4 summarizes the total Indicated and Inferred Resources currently identified in the Bongar\u00e1 project area at various cut-off grades for all five zones.  \\nTABLE 4 BONGAR\u00c1 ZINC MINE PROJECT MINERAL GLOBAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE USING VARIOUS CUT-OFF GRADES  \\n| Zn Cut-Off Grade | Indicated Mineral Resources ||| Inferred Mineral Resources |||\\n|| Tonnes | Zinc (%) | Contained Zn (Lbs) | Tonnes | Zinc (%) | Contained Zn (Lbs) |\\n| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |\\n| 5% | 1,110,000 | 15.9 | 390,000,000 | 1,852,000 | 14.4 | 583,000,000 |\\n| 10% | 822,000 | 18.9 | 342,000,000 | 1,339,000 | 16.8 | 496,000,000 |\\n| 15% | 549,000 | 22.0 | 267,000,000 | 752,000 | 20.1 | 334,000,000 |  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"\\\\- 7 -\" -->\\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/15)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"Watts, Griffis and McOuat\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\nThe reader is cautioned that although Mineral Resources must have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction, they are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Mineral Resources in this estimation are less certain in nature because the amount of exploration has been insufficient to provide the level of confidence necessary to classify them as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource. It is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource category.  \\nZinc One has not carried out metallurgical testing to provide information concerning the recovery of zinc from mineralization at Bongar\u00e1. During 2007-08, the previous operator at the Bongar\u00e1 Mine produced an average of 358 tonnes of ore per day and produced approximately 25,000 tonnes (55.1 million pounds) of zinc metal using a very simple well- established processing method. Zinc One\\'s long-term plans are to continue its exploration of the 8 kilometre long mineralized trend passing through Mina Grande and Mina Chica and extending 6 kilometres to the north-northwest into the Cristal area where previous drilling defined high-grade zinc mineralization. To support this work, Zinc One has applied to the Ministry of Energy and Mining for approval to drill 583 holes from 364 platforms along a 1.4 kilometre long ridge from Mina Grande Sur to and beyond Mina Chica. The platforms planned for in-fill drilling of the known deposits are laid out in a nominal 30 metre grid spacing. Those holes that explore for new mineralization are planned on a nominal 50 metre drilling grid. A total 141 platforms, each to be permitted for two drill holes, will delineate and infill previous drilling at Mina Chica and Mina Grande. Exploration drilling will be prioritized in favourable settings within areas of low-lying or stunted vegetation that may represent areas of zinc toxicity. Currently, Zinc One is addressing environmental and logistical questions posed by the Ministry of Energy and Mining, which will confirm that Zinc One\\'s proposals comply with existing regulations and allow the Ministry to grant the permit.  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"\\\\- 8 -\" -->\\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/16)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"Watts, Griffis and McOuat\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\n2\\\\.

              " Document(page_content='On 26 May 2017, Forrester Metals Inc. (\"FMI\") of Toronto, Ontario Canada accepted the proposal of Watts, Griffis and McOuat Limited (\"WGM\") to prepare a technical report that is compliant with Canada\\'s security rule National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") for the Bongar\u00e1 zinc-oxide project (the \"Project\"), see Figure 1. On June 1, 2017, Zinc One Resources Inc. (\"Zinc One\") of Vancouver, Canada acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Forrester Metals Inc. As a result, this report has been prepared for Zinc One.  \\nThrough a previous engagement, WGM Senior Geologist and Vice-President, Al Workman, P.Geo., and Qualified Person (\"QP\") for the Project, visited the Bongar\u00e1 Project site on 4-7 September, 2014. Part of the previous day was spent in a meeting with Mr. Charles Ushela of Lima, Peru, the representative of C\u00eda. Pilar del Amazonas S.A., which at the time controlled the Bongar\u00e1 concessions consisting of 8,009.5 ha. The adjoining Charlotte- Bongar\u00e1 concessions were owned by Inversiones Charlotte S.A., whose representative was also Mr. Ushela. Mr. Ushela was the main provider of technical information on the Bongar\u00e1 and surrounding areas at the time of WGM\\'s site visit.  \\nDuring the site visit, Mr. Workman examined the Mina Grande Centro and Nort\u00e9 workings (Day 1), the Mine Chica and Bongarita prospects (Day 2), and the Mina Grand\u00e9 Sur area (Day 3). The Mina Grand\u00e9 Centro and Nort\u00e9 workings and Mina Chica were outlined in detail by GPS track at the time they were examined and check sampled by WGM. All track and sample location (waypoint) data were collected using the PSAD-56 datum and imported into Google Earth software. All sites reported an estimated precision error of less than 3 metres. The fourth day was spent at the drying facility near the village of Yambrasbamba in a failed effort to examine Bongar\u00e1 drill core prior to beginning the return trip to Tarapoto (most of the core was lost and remaining core was unusable. A total of 16 samples were collected of mineralization in outcrop for multi-element analysis by ICP, quantitative ore- grade analysis for zinc, lead and silver and a determination of major elements (oxides) by fusion XRF. Water content data and specific gravity determinations were requested on all samples. The samples were delivered by WGM to the SGS laboratory in Lakefield, Ontario. WGM\\'s observations and the results from these samples confirmed the type of mineralization present, its geological setting and the general grade of the mineralization.  \\nDuring 15-18 February, 2018, Al Workman again visited the project site, accompanied by Dr. Bill Williams, COO of Zinc One, for the purpose of reviewing project procedures, the use of quality assurance / quality control protocols and for collecting a small set of check samples  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"\\\\- 9 -\" -->\\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/17)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"Watts, Griffis and McOuat\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\nof typical mineralization. Most of the time on site was spent in prolonged question and answer sessions on project protocols focusing on geological logging, measuring, sampling and security procedures. WGM had the opportunity to observe the drillers activities, the attention paid to rpm and torque, the removal of core from the core-tube and generally how well the drillers and assistants co-ordinate their activities. As it was the rainy season, the working conditions were far from ideal yet WGM observed a high degree of competence and professionalism within the drilling crew. WGM noted the interactions between the drillers and the geologists, and was satisfied that the work was carried out in an atmosphere of mutual co-operation. WGM also observed the geologists logging core and was able to confirm the use of a standardized legend and notational format for recording data. The marking of intervals for analysis, cutting and sampling of drill core followed a conventional approach in accordance with industry best practices. An unusual format was used for numbering samples, however it was well understood by the geologists and served the purpose of identifying intervals without the flagging of consecutive samples that pre-numbered tags provided. WGM\\'s set of 10 duplicate drill core samples provided assays that generally confirmed the Zinc One\\'s assay results (see Section 12.3 in Chapter 12 - Data Verification in this report). Overall, the WGM geologist was satisfied that the degree of care taken on the project site was appropriate, and that the Zinc One exploration program was producing accurate and representative results.  \\nWGM Senior Associate Resource Geologist, John Reddick, P.Geo., visited the project site from 11-13 June, 2018. Mr. Reddick visited all areas of the project in order to better understand the physical and geological setting of the mineralization. He was accompanied by Dr. Bill Williams of Zinc One, and the exploration team. Mr. Reddick observed the drillers in action to gauge the level of expertise and care taken in operating the drill and checked the location of drill pads. In discussion with Zinc One personnel he reviewed sections and plans that were current at the time, checked the logging of drill core and photographed some of the better drill holes for which assay results had been received. Core boxes were weighed to calculate in-situ density to estimate the bulk density of the rock over a defined interval from which the volume could be known. This resulted in a specific gravity value of 1.9 T/m3, for mineralized material that matched well with the overall SG used previously. This is still not well understood as the values for individual boxes of drill core are highly variable, a problem that WGM attributes to the occurrence of voids and also to the presence of broken core. The over-riding purpose of Mr. Reddick\\'s visit was to develop an understanding of the controls on mineralization (oxidized MVT) and its spatial distribution (original contacts modified by oxidation, distribution of economic metal modified by oxidation and chemical transport, contacts modified by post mineral faulting and erosion).  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"\\\\- 10 -\" -->\\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/18)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"Watts, Griffis and McOuat\" -->  \\n</figure>', metadata={'Header 2': '2.1 GENERAL'}),\n",
