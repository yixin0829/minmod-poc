(Al) Workman, P.Geo.\\n\\nSenior Geologist, and Vice-President, Operations\\n\\nand\\n\\nJohn Reddick, P.Geo.\\n\\nSenior Associate Resource Geologist\\n\\nEffective Date: 11 March, 2019 Toronto, Canada\\n\\n# 1.  SUMMARY\\nOn 26 May 2017, Forrester Metals Inc. (\u201cForrester\u201d) of Toronto, Ontario Canada accepted the proposal of Watts, Griffis and McOuat Limited (\"WGM\") to prepare a technical report that is compliant with Canada\u2019s security rule National Instrument 43-101 (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d) for the Bongar\u00e1 zinc-oxide project (the \u201cProject\u201d). On June 1, 2017, Zinc One Resources Inc. (\u201cZinc One\u201d) of Vancouver, Canada acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Forrester Metals Inc. As a result, this report has been prepared for Zinc One.\\n\\nThe area of interest is located in the Yambrasbamba District of Bongar\u00e1 Province within the Amazonas Department in north-central Peru. The Project is located approximately 695 km north-northwest of Lima and 190 west-northwest of the nearest airport at Tarapoto (Figure 1). The Project includes eight mineral concessions for 8,009.5 hectares (\u201cha\u201d) that comprise the Bongar\u00e1 Zinc Mine Project (\u201cBZMP\u201d) and five mineral concessions for 3,115.4 ha that comprise the Charlotte-Bongar\u00e1 Zone Project (\u201cCBZP\u201d).\\n\\nThe Project is hosted within a substantial zinc belt that extends the entire length of Peru and hosts a great many carbonate replacement deposits of various genetic affinities.\\n\\nThe BZMP mineralization was discovered by Canadian geologist William Menges in 1973. A number of companies have explored the area since that time including Noranda Explorations Co. (1974-1984), Canper Resources (1986), Solitario Resources (\u201cSolitario\u201d) (1993-95), Cominco Ltd. (1997)), Mauricio Hochschild & C\u00eda. (\u201cMHC\u201d) (2003-2005), and C\u00eda. Minera Corianta SA (\u201cCorianta\u201d) (2005-2011). Zinc One commenced its exploration program in September, 2017, which started with sampling of existing exploration pits followed by drilling in 2018.\\n\\nWGM first visited the Property in the mid- and late 1980s for Cominco. During 1987, WGM made a historical \u201cpreliminary resource estimate\u201d that was based on 20 test pits and resulted in a historical resource of 325,000 tonnes averaging 27.8% Zn and 1.8% Pb. While this estimate was made by appropriately qualified professionals, it was completed prior to the implementation of current Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\"CIM\") standards for classifying Mineral Resource estimates as required under NI 43-101 and should therefore not be relied upon for investment decisions.\\n\\nMany pits have been excavated, most notably 497 hand-dug pits on a nominal 25 metre grid by Solitario during 1993-95. A subsequent Solitario historical mineral resources estimate in 1995 was based on the test-pits and was predicated on the use of a 7.5% Zn+Pb cut-off grade\\n\\nand a density factor of 2.15 that appears to be a \u201cbest guesstimate\u201d considering there is a high degree of variability in the mineralization. There was no discussion of the impact of moisture content.\\n\\nThis estimate produced historical resources of approximately 1.64 Mt at 19.3% Zn and 2.3% Pb for the main zone of mineralization at Mina Grand\u00e9 and approximately 0.27 Mt at 19.0% Zn and 1.3% Pb in a smaller zone referred to as Mina Chica. Like the historical WGM estimate, these resources are not compliant with CIM standards and guidelines and cannot be relied upon. Following this, MHC drilled 69 diamond holes totalling 1,974.88 m during 2003-2005.\\n\\nThe CBZP was the focus of exploration between 2006 and 2011 by Rio Cristal Resources Corp. and its predecessor (\u201cRio Cristal\u201d). Its mineral concessions covered a larger area than Zinc One\u2019s concessions today. Within that larger area, at least 773 rock, 871 soil and 339 stream-sediment samples were collected, and in addition, 97 diamond holes totalling 9,141.7 m were drilled with a focus on the Cristal and Charlita prospects. Near-surface, high-grade, zinc-oxide mineralization was encountered throughout the area, however an NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate was never filed. Approximately 150,000 tonnes of zinc ore was mined from the Mina Grand\u00e9 Centro and Mina Grand\u00e9 North sectors of the BZMP during 2007-08 (see Figure 1). High-grade ore was shipped to the coast where it was treated using a Waelz kiln to produce zinc calcine that was sold to various smelters and approximately 25,000 tonnes of zinc metal was produced. Corianta explored the area to the northwest and completed surface sampling and trenching at Camp Cielo (see Figure 1).\\n\\nThe most recent historical mineral resources estimated at Bongar\u00e1 are from a 2011 report by Corianta that cited 1.01 Mt at a grade of 21.61% Zn as \u201cmeasured\u201d and \u201cindicated\u201d and 0.21 Mt at a grade of 21.18% Zn a \u201cinferred\u201d from five zones: 1) Mina Grand\u00e9 Sur, 2) Mina Grand\u00e9 Centro, 3) Mina Grand\u00e9 Nort\u00e9, 4) Mina Chica, and 5) Bongarita. Although the resource categories are not compliant with CIM definitions, the higher confidence areas are relevant as they represent the main targets for future exploration and development work on the Bongar\u00e1 zinc-oxide mineralization.\\n\\nWGM has not completed sufficient work to verify any of these historical estimates as current resource estimates, and therefore they cannot be treated as current resource estimates or relied upon for investment decisions.\\n\\nBetween September 2017 and January 2018, Zinc One collected 473 samples from selected historical exploration pits and from the surface in the Bongarita, Mina Chica, Mina Grand\u00e9 Nort\u00e9 and Mina Grand\u00e9 Sur areas (Table 1). Between February and July 2018, Zinc One\\n\\ncompleted 264 diamond drill holes totalling 7,930.6 m using NTW-sized core in the five sectors with known mineralization.\\n\\nTABLE 1\\nSUMMARY OF EXPLORATION COMPLETED,\\nSeptember 2017 \u2013 January, 2018\\nSector,Pit/Surface Samples,Drill Holes,Metres Drilled\\nBongarita,40,36,587.2\\nMina Chica,146,53,\"2,327.9\"\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Nort\u00e9,59,16,449.8\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Centro,0,64,\"2,237.3\"\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Sur,228,95,\"2,328.4\"\\nTotals,473,264,\"7,930.6\"\\n\\nFollowing the surveying, test pitting and drilling programs and the receipt of the assay results from Zinc One\u2019s samples, WGM modelled the geology and estimated the Mineral Resources. The BZMP Mineral Resources occur in five zones of variable mineralization that have the potential for economic extraction of zinc from oxide-type zinc mineralization. The minimum 10% zinc cut-off grade was selected in order to determine the amount of higher-grading mineral resources approaching 20% zinc. WGM\u2019s sensitivity analysis included additional estimates using cut-off grades of 5% and 15% zinc. The block sizes used for the estimates were applied with the assumption that the resources have potential bulk mineable characteristics and have been appropriately estimated using these parameters. Mineral Resource estimates, with an effective date of January 30, 2019, are summarised as follows in Tables 2 and 3.\\n\\nThe various zones on the property were divided into domains that were constrained by grade and geology. WGM\u2019s exploratory data analysis was carried out resulting in the use of 3.0 m run-length composites on the drill hole data for each of the zones.\\n\\nOn the basis of previous historical mining, and recent exploration work by Zinc One during 2017-18, including bulk density measurements on core samples, a bulk density of 1.90 T/m3 was assigned to mineralized material reported in the Mineral Resource estimates.\\n\\nThe Mineral Resource estimates are based on surface diamond drilling, including historical drilling results where the drill sites could be confirmed, as well as recent surface sampling from excavated pits up to several metres deep. There are a total of 320 drill holes with an\\n\\naggregate length of 9,180 m and 723 surface samples with an aggregate length of 2,133 m used for the estimates.\\n\\nOn the basis of WGM\u2019s exploratory data analysis and the grade distribution of zinc assay data, a 40% zinc top cut grade was applied to assay values before compositing. The difference in contained metal between the uncut and cut grades for the resource estimates ranges from about 0.5% to 7% depending on the domain.\\n\\nA 5x5x5m block model was used for each zone with grades interpolated into constrained domains using ordinary kriging.\\n\\nThe cut-off value used for the 2019 resource estimates is based on the three year average metal price US $1.20/lb for Zn. There are no current metallurgical studies for the property and WGM makes no assumptions with respect to recovery of zinc for the Mineral Resource estimates.\\n\\nTABLE 2\\nINDICATED MINERAL RESOURCES FOR THE BONGAR\u00c1 MINE PROJECT\\nas of January, 2019\\nDeposit,Tonnage,Zn Grade (%),Zn (kg),Zn (lbs)\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Sur,\"161,000\",18.2,\"29,300,000\",\"65,000,000\"\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Centro,\"172,000\",17.1,\"29,400,000\",\"65,000,000\"\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Nort\u00e9,\"140,000\",21.0,\"29,400,000\",\"65,000,000\"\\nMina Chica,\"339,000\",19.3,\"65,400,000\",\"144,000,000\"\\nBongarita,\"10,000\",13.8,\"1,400,000\",\"3,000,000\"\\nAll Zones - TOTAL,\"822,000\",18.9,\"155,000,000\",\"342,000,000\"\\n\\nTABLE 3\\nINFERRED MINERAL RESOURCES FOR THE BONGAR\u00c1 MINE PROJECT as of January, 2019\\nDeposit,Tonnage,Zn Grade (%),Zn (kg),Zn (lbs)\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Sur,\"436,000\",17.4,\"75,900,000\",\"167,000,000\"\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Centro,\"201,000\",16.0,\"32,200,000\",\"71,000,000\"\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Nort\u00e9,\"450,000\",16.5,\"74,300,000\",\"164,000,000\"\\nMina Chica,\"252,000\",16.9,\"42,600,000\",\"94,000,000\"\\nBongarita,700,12.7,\"90,000\",\"200,000\"\\nAll Zones - TOTAL,\"1,340,000\",16.8,\"225,000,000\",\"496,000,000\"\\n\\nThe following notes are important to the understanding of the aforementioned report of Mineral Resources:\\n\\n- Resources were estimated using composites within constrained block models with block dimensions of 5x5x5m and using ordinary kriging grade interpolation methods.\\n- Top cuts at a grade of 40% Zn were applied to Zn grades of assays before compositing. A cut-off grade of 10% Zn was applied which incorporates 3 year average metal prices and approximates the cut-off used during past mining operations. Zn% grades can be converted by applying a conversion factor of 22.046 pounds per Zn% to obtain lbs of Zn per metric tonne;\\n- A Bulk Density of 1.90 was applied using the geological block model density field.\\n- Mineral Resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by commodity prices, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues.\\n- The quantity and grade of estimated Inferred Mineral Resources is uncertain in nature as there has been insufficient exploration to define these resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource, and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in up-grading the confidence level of Inferred Resources.\\n- The Mineral Resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\u201cCIM\u201d) Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council May 10, 2014; and mandated in National Instrument 43-101 (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d).\\n- Figures may not total due to rounding.\\nThe mineralized trend on which the zinc-bearing zones are located represents an excellent target for additional drilling. In WGM\u2019s opinion, in-fill drilling with the objective of upgrading the Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated Mineral Resources is warranted. Zinc grade variability is sufficient however, that not all Inferred Resources will be up-graded.  With continuing exploration drilling in the Mina Chica area, some enlargement of the deposit is possible. Exploration drilling along the trend between Mina Chica and Campo Ceilo and\\n\\nsix kilometres (6 km) farther to the Cristal zinc prospect area should be considered in future drilling programs.\\n\\nWith respect to maintaining the data available for Mineral Resource estimation, WGM recommends that Zinc One continue, as it did during 2018, to collect detailed rock quality data (\u201cRQD\u201d) and core recovery data on a sample by sample basis.\\n\\nAlthough the measurement of specific gravity on selected drill core samples to achieve guidance on the bulk density of the mineralization has provided a useful basis for the Mineral Resources estimates, the understanding of bulk density data should be improved through the systematic measuring of larger-scale excavated and drill core samples of typical mineralization. This should be done to provide sufficient data density to develop a bulk density model for the deposits.\\n\\nWGM also recommends that survey control be improved by means of establishing additional permanent monuments in each deposit area to be used for improved location of drill hole coordinates.  Zinc One will continue marking drill hole collars with permanent cement markers.\\n\\nThe existing assay database includes lead and silver analyses, however many of the lead assays and some silver assays exceed the upper detection limit for the analytical technique used. This is not the case for zinc which was re-analysed to ascertain the content for samples exceeding the detection limit. This lack of data has prevented WGM from reliably estimating the average lead and silver grades for the deposits. WGM recommends that the actual lead and silver content be determined for all those samples affected by over-limit assays to allow these metals to be included in the Mineral Resources estimates, and it further recommends that actual values be determined in the future for all over-limit lead and silver values.\\n\\nTable 4 summarizes the total Indicated and Inferred Resources currently identified in the Bongar\u00e1 project area at various cut-off grades for all five zones.\\nTABLE 4\\nBONGAR\u00c1 ZINC MINE PROJECT MINERAL GLOBAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE USING VARIOUS CUT-OFF GRADES\\nZn Cut-Off Grade,Indicated Mineral Resources,,,Inferred Mineral Resources,,\\n,Tonnes,Zinc (%),Contained Zn (Lbs),Tonnes,Zinc (%),Contained Zn (Lbs)\\n5%,\"1,110,000\",15.9,\"390,000,000\",\"1,852,000\",14.4,\"583,000,000\"\\n10%,\"822,000\",18.9,\"342,000,000\",\"1,339,000\",16.8,\"496,000,000\"\\n15%,\"549,000\",22.0,\"267,000,000\",\"752,000\",20.1,\"334,000,000\"\\n\\nThe reader is cautioned that although Mineral Resources must have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction, they are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Mineral Resources in this estimation are less certain in nature because the amount of exploration has been insufficient to provide the level of confidence necessary to classify them as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource. It is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource category.\\n\\nZinc One has not carried out metallurgical testing to provide information concerning the recovery of zinc from mineralization at Bongar\u00e1. During 2007-08, the previous operator at the Bongar\u00e1 Mine produced an average of 358 tonnes of ore per day and produced approximately 25,000 tonnes (55.1 million pounds) of zinc metal using a very simple well-established processing method. Zinc One\u2019s long-term plans are to continue its exploration of the 8 kilometre long mineralized trend passing through Mina Grand\u00e9 and Mina Chica and extending 6 kilometres to the north-northwest into the Cristal area where previous drilling defined high-grade zinc mineralization. To support this work, Zinc One has applied to the Ministry of Energy and Mining for approval to drill 583 holes from 364 platforms along a 1.4 kilometre long ridge from Mina Grand\u00e9 Sur to and beyond Mina Chica. The platforms planned for in-fill drilling of the known deposits are laid out in a nominal 30 metre grid spacing. Those holes that explore for new mineralization are planned on a nominal 50 metre drilling grid. A total 141 platforms, each to be permitted for two drill holes, will delineate and infill previous drilling at Mina Chica and Mina Grand\u00e9. Exploration drilling will be prioritized in favourable settings within areas of low-lying or stunted vegetation that may represent areas of zinc toxicity. Currently, Zinc One is addressing environmental and logistical questions posed by the Ministry of Energy and Mining, which will confirm that Zinc One\u2019s proposals comply with existing regulations and allow the Ministry to grant the permit.\\n\\n# 2.  INTRODUCTION\\n## 2.1 GENERAL\\nOn 26 May 2017, Forrester Metals Inc. (\u201cFMI\u201d) of Toronto, Ontario Canada accepted the proposal of Watts, Griffis and McOuat Limited (\"WGM\") to prepare a technical report that is compliant with Canada\u2019s security rule National Instrument 43-101 (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d) for the Bongar\u00e1 zinc-oxide project (the \u201cProject\u201d), see Figure 1. On June 1, 2017, Zinc One Resources Inc. (\u201cZinc One\u201d) of Vancouver, Canada acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Forrester Metals Inc. As a result, this report has been prepared for Zinc One.\\n\\nThrough a previous engagement, WGM Senior Geologist and Vice-President, Al Workman, P.Geo., and Qualified Person (\u201cQP\u201d) for the Project, visited the Bongar\u00e1 Project site on 4-7 September, 2014. Part of the previous day was spent in a meeting with Mr. Charles Ushela of Lima, Peru, the representative of C\u00eda. Pilar del Amazonas S.A., which at the time controlled the Bongar\u00e1 concessions consisting of 8,009.5 ha. The adjoining Charlotte-Bongar\u00e1 concessions were owned by Inversiones Charlotte S.A., whose representative was also Mr. Ushela. Mr. Ushela was the main provider of technical information on the Bongar\u00e1 and surrounding areas at the time of WGM\u2019s site visit.\\n\\nDuring the site visit, Mr. Workman examined the Mina Grand\u00e9 Centro and Nort\u00e9 workings (Day 1), the Mine Chica and Bongarita prospects (Day 2), and the Mina Grand\u00e9 Sur area (Day 3). The Mina Grand\u00e9 Centro and Nort\u00e9 workings and Mina Chica were outlined in detail by GPS track at the time they were examined and check sampled by WGM. All track and sample location (waypoint) data were collected using the PSAD-56 datum and imported into Google Earth software. All sites reported an estimated precision error of less than 3 metres. The fourth day was spent at the drying facility near the village of Yambrasbamba in a failed effort to examine Bongar\u00e1 drill core prior to beginning the return trip to Tarapoto (most of the core was lost and remaining core was unusable. A total of 16 samples were collected of mineralization in outcrop for multi-element analysis by ICP, quantitative ore-grade analysis for zinc, lead and silver and a determination of major elements (oxides) by fusion XRF. Water content data and specific gravity determinations were requested on all samples. The samples were delivered by WGM to the SGS laboratory in Lakefield, Ontario. WGM\u2019s observations and the results from these samples confirmed the type of mineralization present, its geological setting and the general grade of the mineralization.\\n\\nDuring 15-18 February, 2018, Al Workman again visited the project site, accompanied by Dr. Bill Williams, COO of Zinc One, for the purpose of reviewing project procedures, the use of quality assurance / quality control protocols and for collecting a small set of check samples\\n\\nof typical mineralization. Most of the time on site was spent in prolonged question and answer sessions on project protocols focusing on geological logging, measuring, sampling and security procedures. WGM had the opportunity to observe the drillers activities, the attention paid to rpm and torque, the removal of core from the core-tube and generally how well the drillers and assistants co-ordinate their activities. As it was the rainy season, the working conditions were far from ideal yet WGM observed a high degree of competence and professionalism within the drilling crew. WGM noted the interactions between the drillers and the geologists, and was satisfied that the work was carried out in an atmosphere of mutual co-operation. WGM also observed the geologists logging core and was able to confirm the use of a standardized legend and notational format for recording data. The marking of intervals for analysis, cutting and sampling of drill core followed a conventional approach in accordance with industry best practices. An unusual format was used for numbering samples, however it was well understood by the geologists and served the purpose of identifying intervals without the flagging of consecutive samples that pre-numbered tags provided. WGM\u2019s set of 10 duplicate drill core samples provided assays that generally confirmed the Zinc One\u2019s assay results (see Section 12.3 in Chapter 12 \u2013 Data Verification in this report). Overall, the WGM geologist was satisfied that the degree of care taken on the project site was appropriate, and that the Zinc One exploration program was producing accurate and representative results.\\n\\nWGM Senior Associate Resource Geologist, John Reddick, P.Geo., visited the project site from 11-13 June, 2018. Mr. Reddick visited all areas of the project in order to better understand the physical and geological setting of the mineralization. He was accompanied by Dr. Bill Williams of Zinc One, and the exploration team. Mr. Reddick observed the drillers in action to gauge the level of expertise and care taken in operating the drill and checked the location of drill pads. In discussion with Zinc One personnel he reviewed sections and plans that were current at the time, checked the logging of drill core and photographed some of the better drill holes for which assay results had been received. Core boxes were weighed to calculate in-situ density to estimate the bulk density of the rock over a defined interval from which the volume could be known. This resulted in a specific gravity value of 1.9 T/m3 , for mineralized material that matched well with the overall SG used previously. This is still not well understood as the values for individual boxes of drill core are highly variable, a problem that WGM attributes to the occurrence of voids and also to the presence of broken core. The over-riding purpose of Mr. Reddick\u2019s visit was to develop an understanding of the controls on mineralization (oxidized MVT) and its spatial distribution (original contacts modified by oxidation, distribution of economic metal modified by oxidation and chemical transport, contacts modified by post mineral faulting and erosion).\\n\\n## 2.2 TERMS OF REFERENCE\\nAs a result of a binding letter of intent signed on 27 June, 2016 subsequently amended and signed on 1 September, 2016, and a subsequent vending agreement dated 30 September, 2016, Vena Resources Corp. (\u201cVena\u201d) acquired the right to purchase the Bongar\u00e1 Zinc Mine Project (\u201cBZMP) and the Charlotte-Bongar\u00e1 Zone Project (\u201cCBZP\u201d), both of which combined comprise the \u201cProject\u201d. On 5 October, 2016, Vena formerly changed its name to Forrester Metals Inc. On 1 June, 2017, Zinc One Resources Inc. acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of FMI and subsequently announced that it exercised its option to acquire a 100% interest in the Project, subject to a 2% Net Smelter Return payable to the former owners. As shown in Figure 2, the property comprising the Bongar\u00e1 Project is composed of two blocks of exploration concessions: (1) BZMP comprising eight concessions totalling 8,009.5 ha; and, (2) CBZP comprising five concessions totalling 3,115.4 ha, for a total area of 11,125 ha (111.25 km2).\\n\\nZinc One filed an NI 43-101 compliant technical report prepared by WGM on 8 August, 2017 after the acquisition of FMI; this report was based on that filed by FMI on 11 October, 2016.\\n\\n## 2.3 SOURCES OF INFORMATION\\nThe major sources of information used in the preparation of this report include a large volume of technical reports prepared by various consultants who have been engaged in providing professional services to the former owners and operators of the Bongar\u00e1 project. Some of the reports have been prepared by geologists and engineers working directly for the operators. WGM has also relied on its own experience with the Bongar\u00e1 project having been involved in some of the very earlier evaluation studies during the mid-1980s, including the first resource estimate. These sources of information are listed in the references chapter at the back of this report. Before being engaged by Zinc One, WGM previously visited the project site for another client during which time it examined the major zinc-bearing zones and collected characterization samples for geochemical analysis. In a wider sense, one of the WGM coauthors has also drawn on extensive global experience with non-sulphide zinc deposits in drawing conclusions regarding Zinc One\u2019s project.\\n\\n### 2.3 UNITS AND CURRENCY\\nAll monetary sums relating to zinc prices are reported in United States Dollars (US$) unless stated otherwise. A conversion rate of US$0.77 to the Canadian Dollar (C$) is effective as of the date of this report.\\n\\nMeasurements in this report are stated in the SI (metric) system. Zinc and lead contents are expressed in percent (%). Precious metal contents, notably that for silver, are expressed in grams per tonne (g/t).  One tonne is equivalent to 1.10231 short tons.\\n\\nThe classification of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves in Canada follows the codification established by the CIM. The CIM system, which must be followed in order to ensure NI 43-101 compliance, ranks Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves in terms of confidence level which in turn is a reflection of the types and amounts of exploration work completed and certainty that the results are representative. The conversion of Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves must be based on a feasibility study containing a discussion of mineral economics that establishes the economic viability of the existing resources under a specific set of conditions. These definitions, standards and guidelines can be found at: https://mrmr.cim.org/en/standards/canadian-mineral-resource-and-mineral-reserve-definitions/\\n\\nThe historical resources quoted in this report cannot be precisely confirmed by the authors, and therefore are not in compliance with CIM Standards and should not be relied upon for investment decisions.\\n\\n## 2.4 RISK FACTORS\\nAs is generally the case in the world at large, natural resources including mineral commodities are the property of the sovereign State, and the right to develop and exploit mineral deposits is conveyed to private interests via laws and regulations that govern permitting and licensing procedures and agreements. Mineral projects must therefore meet certain statutory requirements to be permitted to go into production.  This is the case in Peru.\\n\\nIn recent years, the Peruvian Government has moved to improve perceptions concerning mineral project development in the country. This follows a period during which special interest groups encouraged not-for-profit agencies to oppose mining projects in many parts of the country, with adverse consequences for investment and employment in poor rural areas.  Today, the Peru Ministry of Mining and Energy, among others, are supportive of mineral exploration and mining projects and are seeking solutions to promote increased investment in\\n\\nthe Minerals Sector. Investors must also be conscious of the need for a \u2018social licence\u2019 to operate, and thus the authorities will not award any permits without the petitioner having an active and valid agreement with the affected communities.\\n\\nZinc One has been conscientious in maintaining a dialogue with all interested parties in the Project area. At this time, there are no land use restrictions of which WGM is aware that might restrict the ability of Zinc One to access the project areas, or that might restrict its ability to bring the BZMP into production.\\n\\nThe economic viability of the BZMP is likely dependent on outlining additional zinc mineralization to increase the resource base for the Project. Although road access is assured to the Project at this time, other factors that are relevant include:\\n\\n- new mine infrastructure development, especially energy, to support mining;\\n- a reliable water supply; and,\\n- a decision regarding processing options and the need for beneficiation on site.\\nIn June 2017, Zinc One acquired a 100% of the BZMP and CBZP mineral concessions, subject to a 2% Net Smelter Return royalty on production payable to the former concession owners.\\n\\nZinc metal pricing is predominantly established through major metal exchanges such as the London Metal Exchange, commonly referred to as the \u201cLME\u201d. Like many metals, the zinc spot price quoted on the LME has shown some volatility during 2018, trading between approximately $1.05 and $1.64 per pound ($2,315 to $3,616 per tonne). This information drawn from the Kitco Website on 29 January, 2019 shows that the zinc spot price most recently has fluctuated between $1.20 and $1.21/pound ($2,645-$2,667/tonne), (www.kitco.com ). During the past year, LME warehoused zinc has been drawn down from approximately 220,000 tonnes to 115,300 tonnes as at 28 January, 2019. Over a 5-year period, the current LME zinc inventory has fallen from nearly 1 million tonnes in late 2013, a remarkable decline that is continuing. This inventory draw-down is in the face of some new production that has entered the market and is partially the result of suspended operations at many zinc smelters in China. What might be seen as circumstances favouring significantly higher zinc prices in the future is therefore balanced against shut-in production capacity and a fear of an economic slowdown and lower demand during 2019. However, within the context of a mine development timetable, the outlook for higher future zinc prices is generally positive.\\n\\n8. DEPOSIT TYPES\\nAlthough sulphide mineralization is absent in the Bongar\u00e1 area due to weathering and oxidation effects, zinc-lead-silver mineralization is thought to conform to the general provisions of the Mississippi Valley-Type (\u201cMVT\u201d) model for stratabound, carbonate-hosted deposits. These epigenetic deposits occur in all regions of the earth, and in many areas they occur in clusters that define significant mineralized districts. Hypogene sulphide mineralization typically occurs in platform sequence rocks associated with extensional basins. Major MTV districts include the Silesia of eastern Europe, the Viburnum Trend in SE Missouri, the Pine Point area in Canada\u2019s Northwest Territories and the Tri-State area in the United States. According to the US Geological Survey, the median deposit size of 7.0 Mt grading 6% zinc, 1.9% lead, 0.23% copper and 32.5 g silver per tonne. The main ore minerals comprising these deposits are sphalerite and galena, and they are associated with pyrite and marcasite. Gangue minerals include dolomite and calcite, the former being intimately associated with the mineralizing process. Calcite may occur in the form of aragonite veins. Barite may be present in some deposits although it is typically minor. In many parts of the world, MVT deposits in whole or in part have been subject to oxidation due to the effects of oxygenated groundwaters. This commonly occurs in areas that have been significantly up-lifted. For example, the Jabal Dhaylan deposit on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Red Sea coast has been elevated by several hundred metres (or more) as a result of the opening of the Red Sea during the Miocene. Uplift in the Bongar\u00e1 area, situated near the margin of the Pucar\u00e1 Basin in Peru, and the effects of oxidation of the sulphide mineralization, has resulted in the destruction of all hypogene sulphides. In particular, the oxidation of sphalerite generated acidic solutions that allowed zinc to be transported and redeposited as zinc-carbonate and associated mineralization in dolomitized limestones, probably only a very short distance from the original mineralization. In some cases, the non-sulphide mineralization may replace pre-existing sulphides virtually in-situ. Galena is also affected by the oxidation process, and very little evidence is found of the original lead-sulphide mineralization at Bongar\u00e1.\\n\\nFlorida Canyon, which is a more or less \u2018typical\u2019 MVT deposit, occurs within the Pucar\u00e1 Basin and is hosted in dolomitized limestones of the Chambar\u00e1 Formation. It\u2019s stratigraphic setting, in the lowermost part of the Pucar\u00e1 stratigraphy, is typical of such deposits on a global basis and underscores the basic requirements for such deposits: (1) a large basin into which metal-bearing sediments are deposited; (2) deep burial resulting in Eh, pH, temperature and salinity conditions favourable for metal enrichment in interstitial fluids, (3) load compaction leading to the expulsion of pore fluids; (4) a protracted history of subsidence leading to the development of complex fault systems; and, (5) permeable and chemically reactive host rocksinto which the expelled fluids infiltrated.\\n\\nThe deposit forming (metallogenic) process typically involves the expulsion of weakly acidic, metal-bearing brines from deep in the basin as a result of sediment load and compaction. These fluids, which are typically at the low end of the hydrothermal temperature range, may ascend permeable faults zones that develop during basin subsidence and base metal sulphides are deposited as the fluids interact with the first permeable and chemically reactive rocks they encounter. Metal sulphide deposition in some instances is attributed to the interaction of heated metal-bearing fluids with lower temperature, reduced sulphate-bearing formational waters that trigger sulphide precipitation. Subsequent changes in the oxidation state to transform the mineralization from sulphide-dominated species to non-sulphide minerals (carbonates, hydroxides, oxides and silicates) may occur if the sulphide-bearing strata are up-lifted and subjected to a long period of weathering under acid-oxidizing conditions. \\n', metadata={'source': '../data/mock/Bongar\u00e1_Zn_3-2019_mock.txt'})]"

(\u201cForrester\u201d) of Toronto, Ontario Canada accepted the proposal of Watts, Griffis and McOuat Limited (\"WGM\") to prepare a technical report that is compliant with Canada\u2019s security rule National Instrument 43-101 (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d) for the Bongar\u00e1 zinc-oxide project (the \u201cProject\u201d). On June 1, 2017, Zinc One Resources Inc. (\u201cZinc One\u201d) of Vancouver, Canada acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Forrester Metals Inc. As a result, this report has been prepared for Zinc One.  \\nThe area of interest is located in the Yambrasbamba District of Bongar\u00e1 Province within the Amazonas Department in north-central Peru. The Project is located approximately 695 km north-northwest of Lima and 190 west-northwest of the nearest airport at Tarapoto (Figure 1). The Project includes eight mineral concessions for 8,009.5 hectares (\u201cha\u201d) that comprise the Bongar\u00e1 Zinc Mine Project (\u201cBZMP\u201d) and five mineral concessions for 3,115.4 ha that comprise the Charlotte-Bongar\u00e1 Zone Project (\u201cCBZP\u201d).  \\nThe Project is hosted within a substantial zinc belt that extends the entire length of Peru and hosts a great many carbonate replacement deposits of various genetic affinities.  \\nThe BZMP mineralization was discovered by Canadian geologist William Menges in 1973. A number of companies have explored the area since that time including Noranda Explorations Co. (1974-1984), Canper Resources (1986), Solitario Resources (\u201cSolitario\u201d) (1993-95), Cominco Ltd. (1997)), Mauricio Hochschild & C\u00eda. (\u201cMHC\u201d) (2003-2005), and C\u00eda. Minera Corianta SA (\u201cCorianta\u201d) (2005-2011). Zinc One commenced its exploration program in September, 2017, which started with sampling of existing exploration pits followed by drilling in 2018.  \\nWGM first visited the Property in the mid- and late 1980s for Cominco. During 1987, WGM made a historical \u201cpreliminary resource estimate\u201d that was based on 20 test pits and resulted in a historical resource of 325,000 tonnes averaging 27.8% Zn and 1.8% Pb. While this estimate was made by appropriately qualified professionals, it was completed prior to the implementation of current Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\"CIM\") standards for classifying Mineral Resource estimates as required under NI 43-101 and should therefore not be relied upon for investment decisions.  \\nMany pits have been excavated, most notably 497 hand-dug pits on a nominal 25 metre grid by Solitario during 1993-95. A subsequent Solitario historical mineral resources estimate in 1995 was based on the test-pits and was predicated on the use of a 7.5% Zn+Pb cut-off grade  \\nand a density factor of 2.15 that appears to be a \u201cbest guesstimate\u201d considering there is a high degree of variability in the mineralization. There was no discussion of the impact of moisture content.  \\nThis estimate produced historical resources of approximately 1.64 Mt at 19.3% Zn and 2.3% Pb for the main zone of mineralization at Mina Grand\u00e9 and approximately 0.27 Mt at 19.0% Zn and 1.3% Pb in a smaller zone referred to as Mina Chica. Like the historical WGM estimate, these resources are not compliant with CIM standards and guidelines and cannot be relied upon. Following this, MHC drilled 69 diamond holes totalling 1,974.88 m during 2003-2005.  \\nThe CBZP was the focus of exploration between 2006 and 2011 by Rio Cristal Resources Corp. and its predecessor (\u201cRio Cristal\u201d). Its mineral concessions covered a larger area than Zinc One\u2019s concessions today. Within that larger area, at least 773 rock, 871 soil and 339 stream-sediment samples were collected, and in addition, 97 diamond holes totalling 9,141.7 m were drilled with a focus on the Cristal and Charlita prospects. Near-surface, high-grade, zinc-oxide mineralization was encountered throughout the area, however an NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate was never filed. Approximately 150,000 tonnes of zinc ore was mined from the Mina Grand\u00e9 Centro and Mina Grand\u00e9 North sectors of the BZMP during 2007-08 (see Figure 1). High-grade ore was shipped to the coast where it was treated using a Waelz kiln to produce zinc calcine that was sold to various smelters and approximately 25,000 tonnes of zinc metal was produced. Corianta explored the area to the northwest and completed surface sampling and trenching at Camp Cielo (see Figure 1).  \\nThe most recent historical mineral resources estimated at Bongar\u00e1 are from a 2011 report by Corianta that cited 1.01 Mt at a grade of 21.61% Zn as \u201cmeasured\u201d and \u201cindicated\u201d and 0.21 Mt at a grade of 21.18% Zn a \u201cinferred\u201d from five zones: 1) Mina Grand\u00e9 Sur, 2) Mina Grand\u00e9 Centro, 3) Mina Grand\u00e9 Nort\u00e9, 4) Mina Chica, and 5) Bongarita. Although the resource categories are not compliant with CIM definitions, the higher confidence areas are relevant as they represent the main targets for future exploration and development work on the Bongar\u00e1 zinc-oxide mineralization.  \\nWGM has not completed sufficient work to verify any of these historical estimates as current resource estimates, and therefore they cannot be treated as current resource estimates or relied upon for investment decisions.  \\nBetween September 2017 and January 2018, Zinc One collected 473 samples from selected historical exploration pits and from the surface in the Bongarita, Mina Chica, Mina Grand\u00e9 Nort\u00e9 and Mina Grand\u00e9 Sur areas (Table 1). Between February and July 2018, Zinc One  \\ncompleted 264 diamond drill holes totalling 7,930.6 m using NTW-sized core in the five sectors with known mineralization.  \\nTABLE 1\\nSUMMARY OF EXPLORATION COMPLETED,\\nSeptember 2017 \u2013 January, 2018\\nSector,Pit/Surface Samples,Drill Holes,Metres Drilled\\nBongarita,40,36,587.2\\nMina Chica,146,53,\"2,327.9\"\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Nort\u00e9,59,16,449.8\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Centro,0,64,\"2,237.3\"\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Sur,228,95,\"2,328.4\"\\nTotals,473,264,\"7,930.6\"  \\nFollowing the surveying, test pitting and drilling programs and the receipt of the assay results from Zinc One\u2019s samples, WGM modelled the geology and estimated the Mineral Resources. The BZMP Mineral Resources occur in five zones of variable mineralization that have the potential for economic extraction of zinc from oxide-type zinc mineralization. The minimum 10% zinc cut-off grade was selected in order to determine the amount of higher-grading mineral resources approaching 20% zinc. WGM\u2019s sensitivity analysis included additional estimates using cut-off grades of 5% and 15% zinc. The block sizes used for the estimates were applied with the assumption that the resources have potential bulk mineable characteristics and have been appropriately estimated using these parameters. Mineral Resource estimates, with an effective date of January 30, 2019, are summarised as follows in Tables 2 and 3.  \\nThe various zones on the property were divided into domains that were constrained by grade and geology. WGM\u2019s exploratory data analysis was carried out resulting in the use of 3.0 m run-length composites on the drill hole data for each of the zones.  \\nOn the basis of previous historical mining, and recent exploration work by Zinc One during 2017-18, including bulk density measurements on core samples, a bulk density of 1.90 T/m3 was assigned to mineralized material reported in the Mineral Resource estimates.  \\nThe Mineral Resource estimates are based on surface diamond drilling, including historical drilling results where the drill sites could be confirmed, as well as recent surface sampling from excavated pits up to several metres deep. There are a total of 320 drill holes with an  \\naggregate length of 9,180 m and 723 surface samples with an aggregate length of 2,133 m used for the estimates.  \\nOn the basis of WGM\u2019s exploratory data analysis and the grade distribution of zinc assay data, a 40% zinc top cut grade was applied to assay values before compositing. The difference in contained metal between the uncut and cut grades for the resource estimates ranges from about 0.5% to 7% depending on the domain.  \\nA 5x5x5m block model was used for each zone with grades interpolated into constrained domains using ordinary kriging.  \\nThe cut-off value used for the 2019 resource estimates is based on the three year average metal price US $1.20/lb for Zn. There are no current metallurgical studies for the property and WGM makes no assumptions with respect to recovery of zinc for the Mineral Resource estimates.  \\nTABLE 2\\nINDICATED MINERAL RESOURCES FOR THE BONGAR\u00c1 MINE PROJECT\\nas of January, 2019\\nDeposit,Tonnage,Zn Grade (%),Zn (kg),Zn (lbs)\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Sur,\"161,000\",18.2,\"29,300,000\",\"65,000,000\"\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Centro,\"172,000\",17.1,\"29,400,000\",\"65,000,000\"\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Nort\u00e9,\"140,000\",21.0,\"29,400,000\",\"65,000,000\"\\nMina Chica,\"339,000\",19.3,\"65,400,000\",\"144,000,000\"\\nBongarita,\"10,000\",13.8,\"1,400,000\",\"3,000,000\"\\nAll Zones - TOTAL,\"822,000\",18.9,\"155,000,000\",\"342,000,000\"  \\nTABLE 3\\nINFERRED MINERAL RESOURCES FOR THE BONGAR\u00c1 MINE PROJECT as of January, 2019\\nDeposit,Tonnage,Zn Grade (%),Zn (kg),Zn (lbs)\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Sur,\"436,000\",17.4,\"75,900,000\",\"167,000,000\"\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Centro,\"201,000\",16.0,\"32,200,000\",\"71,000,000\"\\nMina Grand\u00e9 Nort\u00e9,\"450,000\",16.5,\"74,300,000\",\"164,000,000\"\\nMina Chica,\"252,000\",16.9,\"42,600,000\",\"94,000,000\"\\nBongarita,700,12.7,\"90,000\",\"200,000\"\\nAll Zones - TOTAL,\"1,340,000\",16.8,\"225,000,000\",\"496,000,000\"  \\nThe following notes are important to the understanding of the aforementioned report of Mineral Resources:  \\n- Resources were estimated using composites within constrained block models with block dimensions of 5x5x5m and using ordinary kriging grade interpolation methods.\\n- Top cuts at a grade of 40% Zn were applied to Zn grades of assays before compositing. A cut-off grade of 10% Zn was applied which incorporates 3 year average metal prices and approximates the cut-off used during past mining operations. Zn% grades can be converted by applying a conversion factor of 22.046 pounds per Zn% to obtain lbs of Zn per metric tonne;\\n- A Bulk Density of 1.90 was applied using the geological block model density field.\\n- Mineral Resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by commodity prices, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues.\\n- The quantity and grade of estimated Inferred Mineral Resources is uncertain in nature as there has been insufficient exploration to define these resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource, and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in up-grading the confidence level of Inferred Resources.\\n- The Mineral Resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\u201cCIM\u201d) Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council May 10, 2014; and mandated in National Instrument 43-101 (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d).\\n- Figures may not total due to rounding.\\nThe mineralized trend on which the zinc-bearing zones are located represents an excellent target for additional drilling. In WGM\u2019s opinion, in-fill drilling with the objective of upgrading the Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated Mineral Resources is warranted. Zinc grade variability is sufficient however, that not all Inferred Resources will be up-graded.  With continuing exploration drilling in the Mina Chica area, some enlargement of the deposit is possible. Exploration drilling along the trend between Mina Chica and Campo Ceilo and  \\nsix kilometres (6 km) farther to the Cristal zinc prospect area should be considered in future drilling programs.  \\nWith respect to maintaining the data available for Mineral Resource estimation, WGM recommends that Zinc One continue, as it did during 2018, to collect detailed rock quality data (\u201cRQD\u201d) and core recovery data on a sample by sample basis.  \\nAlthough the measurement of specific gravity on selected drill core samples to achieve guidance on the bulk density of the mineralization has provided a useful basis for the Mineral Resources estimates, the understanding of bulk density data should be improved through the systematic measuring of larger-scale excavated and drill core samples of typical mineralization. This should be done to provide sufficient data density to develop a bulk density model for the deposits.  \\nWGM also recommends that survey control be improved by means of establishing additional permanent monuments in each deposit area to be used for improved location of drill hole coordinates.  Zinc One will continue marking drill hole collars with permanent cement markers.  \\nThe existing assay database includes lead and silver analyses, however many of the lead assays and some silver assays exceed the upper detection limit for the analytical technique used. This is not the case for zinc which was re-analysed to ascertain the content for samples exceeding the detection limit. This lack of data has prevented WGM from reliably estimating the average lead and silver grades for the deposits. WGM recommends that the actual lead and silver content be determined for all those samples affected by over-limit assays to allow these metals to be included in the Mineral Resources estimates, and it further recommends that actual values be determined in the future for all over-limit lead and silver values.  \\nTable 4 summarizes the total Indicated and Inferred Resources currently identified in the Bongar\u00e1 project area at various cut-off grades for all five zones.\\nTABLE 4\\nBONGAR\u00c1 ZINC MINE PROJECT MINERAL GLOBAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE USING VARIOUS CUT-OFF GRADES\\nZn Cut-Off Grade,Indicated Mineral Resources,,,Inferred Mineral Resources,,\\n,Tonnes,Zinc (%),Contained Zn (Lbs),Tonnes,Zinc (%),Contained Zn (Lbs)\\n5%,\"1,110,000\",15.9,\"390,000,000\",\"1,852,000\",14.4,\"583,000,000\"\\n10%,\"822,000\",18.9,\"342,000,000\",\"1,339,000\",16.8,\"496,000,000\"\\n15%,\"549,000\",22.0,\"267,000,000\",\"752,000\",20.1,\"334,000,000\"  \\nThe reader is cautioned that although Mineral Resources must have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction, they are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Mineral Resources in this estimation are less certain in nature because the amount of exploration has been insufficient to provide the level of confidence necessary to classify them as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource. It is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource category.  \\nZinc One has not carried out metallurgical testing to provide information concerning the recovery of zinc from mineralization at Bongar\u00e1. During 2007-08, the previous operator at the Bongar\u00e1 Mine produced an average of 358 tonnes of ore per day and produced approximately 25,000 tonnes (55.1 million pounds) of zinc metal using a very simple well-established processing method. Zinc One\u2019s long-term plans are to continue its exploration of the 8 kilometre long mineralized trend passing through Mina Grand\u00e9 and Mina Chica and extending 6 kilometres to the north-northwest into the Cristal area where previous drilling defined high-grade zinc mineralization. To support this work, Zinc One has applied to the Ministry of Energy and Mining for approval to drill 583 holes from 364 platforms along a 1.4 kilometre long ridge from Mina Grand\u00e9 Sur to and beyond Mina Chica. The platforms planned for in-fill drilling of the known deposits are laid out in a nominal 30 metre grid spacing. Those holes that explore for new mineralization are planned on a nominal 50 metre drilling grid. A total 141 platforms, each to be permitted for two drill holes, will delineate and infill previous drilling at Mina Chica and Mina Grand\u00e9. Exploration drilling will be prioritized in favourable settings within areas of low-lying or stunted vegetation that may represent areas of zinc toxicity. Currently, Zinc One is addressing environmental and logistical questions posed by the Ministry of Energy and Mining, which will confirm that Zinc One\u2019s proposals comply with existing regulations and allow the Ministry to grant the permit.', metadata={'Header 1': '1.

(\u201cFMI\u201d) of Toronto, Ontario Canada accepted the proposal of Watts, Griffis and McOuat Limited (\"WGM\") to prepare a technical report that is compliant with Canada\u2019s security rule National Instrument 43-101 (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d) for the Bongar\u00e1 zinc-oxide project (the \u201cProject\u201d), see Figure 1. On June 1, 2017, Zinc One Resources Inc. (\u201cZinc One\u201d) of Vancouver, Canada acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Forrester Metals Inc. As a result, this report has been prepared for Zinc One.  \\nThrough a previous engagement, WGM Senior Geologist and Vice-President, Al Workman, P.Geo., and Qualified Person (\u201cQP\u201d) for the Project, visited the Bongar\u00e1 Project site on 4-7 September, 2014. Part of the previous day was spent in a meeting with Mr. Charles Ushela of Lima, Peru, the representative of C\u00eda. Pilar del Amazonas S.A., which at the time controlled the Bongar\u00e1 concessions consisting of 8,009.5 ha. The adjoining Charlotte-Bongar\u00e1 concessions were owned by Inversiones Charlotte S.A., whose representative was also Mr. Ushela. Mr. Ushela was the main provider of technical information on the Bongar\u00e1 and surrounding areas at the time of WGM\u2019s site visit.  \\nDuring the site visit, Mr. Workman examined the Mina Grand\u00e9 Centro and Nort\u00e9 workings (Day 1), the Mine Chica and Bongarita prospects (Day 2), and the Mina Grand\u00e9 Sur area (Day 3). The Mina Grand\u00e9 Centro and Nort\u00e9 workings and Mina Chica were outlined in detail by GPS track at the time they were examined and check sampled by WGM. All track and sample location (waypoint) data were collected using the PSAD-56 datum and imported into Google Earth software. All sites reported an estimated precision error of less than 3 metres. The fourth day was spent at the drying facility near the village of Yambrasbamba in a failed effort to examine Bongar\u00e1 drill core prior to beginning the return trip to Tarapoto (most of the core was lost and remaining core was unusable. A total of 16 samples were collected of mineralization in outcrop for multi-element analysis by ICP, quantitative ore-grade analysis for zinc, lead and silver and a determination of major elements (oxides) by fusion XRF. Water content data and specific gravity determinations were requested on all samples. The samples were delivered by WGM to the SGS laboratory in Lakefield, Ontario. WGM\u2019s observations and the results from these samples confirmed the type of mineralization present, its geological setting and the general grade of the mineralization.  \\nDuring 15-18 February, 2018, Al Workman again visited the project site, accompanied by Dr. Bill Williams, COO of Zinc One, for the purpose of reviewing project procedures, the use of quality assurance / quality control protocols and for collecting a small set of check samples  \\nof typical mineralization. Most of the time on site was spent in prolonged question and answer sessions on project protocols focusing on geological logging, measuring, sampling and security procedures. WGM had the opportunity to observe the drillers activities, the attention paid to rpm and torque, the removal of core from the core-tube and generally how well the drillers and assistants co-ordinate their activities. As it was the rainy season, the working conditions were far from ideal yet WGM observed a high degree of competence and professionalism within the drilling crew. WGM noted the interactions between the drillers and the geologists, and was satisfied that the work was carried out in an atmosphere of mutual co-operation. WGM also observed the geologists logging core and was able to confirm the use of a standardized legend and notational format for recording data. The marking of intervals for analysis, cutting and sampling of drill core followed a conventional approach in accordance with industry best practices. An unusual format was used for numbering samples, however it was well understood by the geologists and served the purpose of identifying intervals without the flagging of consecutive samples that pre-numbered tags provided. WGM\u2019s set of 10 duplicate drill core samples provided assays that generally confirmed the Zinc One\u2019s assay results (see Section 12.3 in Chapter 12 \u2013 Data Verification in this report). Overall, the WGM geologist was satisfied that the degree of care taken on the project site was appropriate, and that the Zinc One exploration program was producing accurate and representative results.  \\nWGM Senior Associate Resource Geologist, John Reddick, P.Geo., visited the project site from 11-13 June, 2018. Mr. Reddick visited all areas of the project in order to better understand the physical and geological setting of the mineralization. He was accompanied by Dr. Bill Williams of Zinc One, and the exploration team. Mr. Reddick observed the drillers in action to gauge the level of expertise and care taken in operating the drill and checked the location of drill pads. In discussion with Zinc One personnel he reviewed sections and plans that were current at the time, checked the logging of drill core and photographed some of the better drill holes for which assay results had been received. Core boxes were weighed to calculate in-situ density to estimate the bulk density of the rock over a defined interval from which the volume could be known. This resulted in a specific gravity value of 1.9 T/m3 , for mineralized material that matched well with the overall SG used previously. This is still not well understood as the values for individual boxes of drill core are highly variable, a problem that WGM attributes to the occurrence of voids and also to the presence of broken core. The over-riding purpose of Mr. Reddick\u2019s visit was to develop an understanding of the controls on mineralization (oxidized MVT) and its spatial distribution (original contacts modified by oxidation, distribution of economic metal modified by oxidation and chemical transport, contacts modified by post mineral faulting and erosion).', metadata={'Header 1': '2.

              " Document(page_content='As is generally the case in the world at large, natural resources including mineral commodities are the property of the sovereign State, and the right to develop and exploit mineral deposits is conveyed to private interests via laws and regulations that govern permitting and licensing procedures and agreements. Mineral projects must therefore meet certain statutory requirements to be permitted to go into production.  This is the case in Peru.  \\nIn recent years, the Peruvian Government has moved to improve perceptions concerning mineral project development in the country. This follows a period during which special interest groups encouraged not-for-profit agencies to oppose mining projects in many parts of the country, with adverse consequences for investment and employment in poor rural areas.  Today, the Peru Ministry of Mining and Energy, among others, are supportive of mineral exploration and mining projects and are seeking solutions to promote increased investment in  \\nthe Minerals Sector. Investors must also be conscious of the need for a \u2018social licence\u2019 to operate, and thus the authorities will not award any permits without the petitioner having an active and valid agreement with the affected communities.  \\nZinc One has been conscientious in maintaining a dialogue with all interested parties in the Project area. At this time, there are no land use restrictions of which WGM is aware that might restrict the ability of Zinc One to access the project areas, or that might restrict its ability to bring the BZMP into production.  \\nThe economic viability of the BZMP is likely dependent on outlining additional zinc mineralization to increase the resource base for the Project. Although road access is assured to the Project at this time, other factors that are relevant include:  \\n- new mine infrastructure development, especially energy, to support mining;\\n- a reliable water supply; and,\\n- a decision regarding processing options and the need for beneficiation on site.\\nIn June 2017, Zinc One acquired a 100% of the BZMP and CBZP mineral concessions, subject to a 2% Net Smelter Return royalty on production payable to the former concession owners.  \\nZinc metal pricing is predominantly established through major metal exchanges such as the London Metal Exchange, commonly referred to as the \u201cLME\u201d. Like many metals, the zinc spot price quoted on the LME has shown some volatility during 2018, trading between approximately $1.05 and $1.64 per pound ($2,315 to $3,616 per tonne). This information drawn from the Kitco Website on 29 January, 2019 shows that the zinc spot price most recently has fluctuated between $1.20 and $1.21/pound ($2,645-$2,667/tonne), (www.kitco.com ). During the past year, LME warehoused zinc has been drawn down from approximately 220,000 tonnes to 115,300 tonnes as at 28 January, 2019. Over a 5-year period, the current LME zinc inventory has fallen from nearly 1 million tonnes in late 2013, a remarkable decline that is continuing. This inventory draw-down is in the face of some new production that has entered the market and is partially the result of suspended operations at many zinc smelters in China. What might be seen as circumstances favouring significantly higher zinc prices in the future is therefore balanced against shut-in production capacity and a fear of an economic slowdown and lower demand during 2019. However, within the context of a mine development timetable, the outlook for higher future zinc prices is generally positive.', metadata={'Header 1': '2.

              " Document(page_content='Although sulphide mineralization is absent in the Bongar\u00e1 area due to weathering and oxidation effects, zinc-lead-silver mineralization is thought to conform to the general provisions of the Mississippi Valley-Type (\u201cMVT\u201d) model for stratabound, carbonate-hosted deposits. These epigenetic deposits occur in all regions of the earth, and in many areas they occur in clusters that define significant mineralized districts. Hypogene sulphide mineralization typically occurs in platform sequence rocks associated with extensional basins. Major MTV districts include the Silesia of eastern Europe, the Viburnum Trend in SE Missouri, the Pine Point area in Canada\u2019s Northwest Territories and the Tri-State area in the United States. According to the US Geological Survey, the median deposit size of 7.0 Mt grading 6% zinc, 1.9% lead, 0.23% copper and 32.5 g silver per tonne. The main ore minerals comprising these deposits are sphalerite and galena, and they are associated with pyrite and marcasite. Gangue minerals include dolomite and calcite, the former being intimately associated with the mineralizing process. Calcite may occur in the form of aragonite veins. Barite may be present in some deposits although it is typically minor. In many parts of the world, MVT deposits in whole or in part have been subject to oxidation due to the effects of oxygenated groundwaters. This commonly occurs in areas that have been significantly up-lifted. For example, the Jabal Dhaylan deposit on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Red Sea coast has been elevated by several hundred metres (or more) as a result of the opening of the Red Sea during the Miocene. Uplift in the Bongar\u00e1 area, situated near the margin of the Pucar\u00e1 Basin in Peru, and the effects of oxidation of the sulphide mineralization, has resulted in the destruction of all hypogene sulphides. In particular, the oxidation of sphalerite generated acidic solutions that allowed zinc to be transported and redeposited as zinc-carbonate and associated mineralization in dolomitized limestones, probably only a very short distance from the original mineralization. In some cases, the non-sulphide mineralization may replace pre-existing sulphides virtually in-situ. Galena is also affected by the oxidation process, and very little evidence is found of the original lead-sulphide mineralization at Bongar\u00e1.  \\nFlorida Canyon, which is a more or less \u2018typical\u2019 MVT deposit, occurs within the Pucar\u00e1 Basin and is hosted in dolomitized limestones of the Chambar\u00e1 Formation. It\u2019s stratigraphic setting, in the lowermost part of the Pucar\u00e1 stratigraphy, is typical of such deposits on a global basis and underscores the basic requirements for such deposits: (1) a large basin into which metal-bearing sediments are deposited; (2) deep burial resulting in Eh, pH, temperature and salinity conditions favourable for metal enrichment in interstitial fluids, (3) load compaction leading to the expulsion of pore fluids; (4) a protracted history of subsidence leading to the development of complex fault systems; and, (5) permeable and chemically reactive host rocksinto which the expelled fluids infiltrated.  \\nThe deposit forming (metallogenic) process typically involves the expulsion of weakly acidic, metal-bearing brines from deep in the basin as a result of sediment load and compaction. These fluids, which are typically at the low end of the hydrothermal temperature range, may ascend permeable faults zones that develop during basin subsidence and base metal sulphides are deposited as the fluids interact with the first permeable and chemically reactive rocks they encounter. Metal sulphide deposition in some instances is attributed to the interaction of heated metal-bearing fluids with lower temperature, reduced sulphate-bearing formational waters that trigger sulphide precipitation. Subsequent changes in the oxidation state to transform the mineralization from sulphide-dominated species to non-sulphide minerals (carbonates, hydroxides, oxides and silicates) may occur if the sulphide-bearing strata are up-lifted and subjected to a long period of weathering under acid-oxidizing conditions.', metadata={'Header 1': '8.
