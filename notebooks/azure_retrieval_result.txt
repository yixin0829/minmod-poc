The classification of the Mineral Resources in this report conforms to the CIM Definitions and Standards for the classification of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates as adopted by CIM Council on May 10, 2014 and as incorporated in Canada's security rule National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101").
The classification of blocks was checked manually and isolated blocks, or small groups of isolated blocks, were reclassified to prevent inconsistent variations in localised classification.

| All Zones - TOTAL | 1,340,000 | 16.8 | 225,000,000 | 496,000,000 |
Notes:
1\. Resources were estimated using composites within constrained block models with block dimensions of 5x5x5m and using ordinary kriging grade interpolation methods.
2\. Top cuts at a grade of 40% Zn were applied to Zn grades of assays before compositing. A cut-off grade of 10% Zn was applied which incorporates 3 year average metal prices and approximates the cut-off used during past mining operations. Zn% grades can be converted by applying a conversion factor of 22.046 pounds per Zn% to obtain lbs of Zn per metric tonne.
3\. A Bulk Density of 1.90 was applied using the geological block model density field.
4\. Mineral Resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by commodity prices, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues;
5\. The quantity and grade of estimated Inferred Mineral Resources is uncertain in nature as there has been insufficient exploration to define these resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource, and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in up-grading the confidence level of Inferred Resources.
6\. The Mineral Resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum ("CIM") Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council May 10, 2014.

\*A top cut of 40% Zn was applied to assays above 40% Zn before compositing.The Mineral Resource estimates have been prepared by John Reddick, M.Sc., P.Geo., who is a Senior Associate Resource Geologist of WGM. Mr. Reddick is a Consulting Geologist and is independent of Zinc One Resources Inc. and Forrester Metals S.A.C.
The Mineral Resource estimates presented in this report provide an update to and/or replace all previous resource estimates for five of the deposits on the BZMP. From south to north the deposits with Mineral Resource estimates in this report are:
· Mina Grandé Sur ("MGS");
· Mina Grandé Centro ("MGC");
· Mina Grandé Norté ("MGN");
· Mina Chica ("MC"); and
· Bongarita.
All of the estimated Mineral Resources occur in zones of oxidized polymetallic carbonate- hosted mineralization that have the potential for economic extraction of zinc. Relative to the high-grade zinc mineralization commonly present, much lesser amounts of lead and silver co- exist with the zinc, however these are found in amounts that may not significantly impact the economic value of the zinc mineralization. The estimates presented here are considered to be effective as of January 30, 2019.
The minimum cut-off grade and the block size used for the resource estimates were applied with the assumption that resources with potential bulk mineable characteristics have been appropriately estimated using these parameters. A minimum cut-off value of 10% Zn was established for resource estimates which is similar to that used for previous historical estimates and when the property was in production during 2007-2008. It was also used in order to determine the amount of higher-grading mineral resources approaching 20% zinc. WGM's sensitivity analysis included additional estimates using cut-off grades of 5% and 15% zinc. There are no current metallurgical studies for the property and WGM makes no assumptions with respect to recovery of zinc for the Mineral Resource estimates.
WGM's Mineral Resources estimates as of January 20, 2019 and the contained metal are summarised in Tables 28 and 29.

The estimates for the Mina Grande Centro and Mina Grandé Norté deposits have taken into account the removal of previously mined material extracted during 2007-2008 as data provided by Zinc One reflects the current topography (post-mining and reclamation). Drill holes from the mined areas were removed from the database. Previous mining was by means of open pit mining on two shallow benches at Mina Grande Centro and Mina Grande North (see photographic plates 3 and 4 in this report). No detailed record of mined ore or waste material was available to allow WGM to reconcile past production.All monetary sums relating to zinc prices are reported in United States Dollars (US$) unless stated otherwise. A conversion rate of US$0.77 to the Canadian Dollar (C$) is effective as of the date of this report.
Measurements in this report are stated in the SI (metric) system. Zinc and lead contents are expressed in percent (%). Precious metal contents, notably that for silver, are expressed in grams per tonne (g/t). One tonne is equivalent to 1.10231 short tons.
The classification of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves in Canada follows the codification established by the CIM. The CIM system, which must be followed in order to ensure NI 43-101 compliance, ranks Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves in terms of confidence level which in turn is a reflection of the types and amounts of exploration work completed and certainty that the results are representative. The conversion of Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves must be based on a feasibility study containing a discussion of mineral economics that establishes the economic viability of the existing resources under a specific set of conditions. These definitions, standards and guidelines can be found at: https://mrmr.cim.org/en/standards/canadian-mineral-resource-and-mineral-reserve-definitions/
The historical resources quoted in this report cannot be precisely confirmed by the authors, and therefore are not in compliance with CIM Standards and should not be relied upon for investment decisions.
